# Introduction to Statistics {#intro-stat}

Welcome to your introduction to statistics.  You will be learning the basics of statistics, along with applications of statistics within the R language.  This book will provide fundamentals of the concepts and the code to apply these concepts in R.  At the end of each section, you will also find the Python code that will perform a comparable analysis (however, in class, we will be discussing the R code).\
This Chapter aims to answer the following questions:
<ul>
  <li> What type of data is being analyzed? 
    <ul> 
      <li> Nominal 
      <li> Ordinal
      <li> Continuous/Discrete
</ul>
  <li> How do we describe distributions of these variables?
    <ul> 
      <li> Center 
      <li> Spread
      <li> Shape
      <li> Graphical Display
</ul>
  <li> How do we create confidence intervals for parameters?
    <ul> 
</ul>
  <li> How do we perform hypothesis testing?
    <ul> 
      <li> One sample t-test 
      <li> Two sample t-test
          <li> Testing Normality
          <li> Testing Equality of Variances
          <li> Testing Equality of Means
          <li> Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test


The following packages will be used in this textbook. Below we install and add the packages to our libraries so that any version issues can be dealt with at the beginning of the course. Sometimes packages require that you update to the latest version of R; if you see an error that indicates that situation, download the latest version of R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) and install it.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) {#eda}

The crucial first step to any data science problem is exploratory data analysis (EDA). Before you attempt to run any models, or jump towards any formal statistical analysis, you must ___explore your data___. Many unexpected frustrations arise when exploratory analysis is overlooked; knowing your data is critical to your ability to make necessary assumptions about it. This preliminary analysis will help inform our decisions for data manipulation, give us a base-level understanding of our variables and the relationships between them, and help determine which statistical analyses might be appropriate for the questions we are trying to answer. Some of the questions we aim to answer through exploratory analysis are:
<ul>
<li> What kind of variables to you have? 
<ul> 
<li> Continuous
<li> Nominal
<li> Ordinal
</ul>
<li> How are the attributes stored?
<ul>
<li> Strings
<li> Integers
<li> Floats/Numeric
<li> Dates
</ul>
<li> What do their distributions look like?
<ul>
<li> Center/Location
<li> Spread
<li> Shape
</ul>
<li> Are there any anomolies?
<ul>
<li> Outliers
<li> Leverage points
<li> Missing values
<li> Low-frequency categories
</ul>
</ul>

 Throughout the textbook, we will continue to use a real-estate data set that contains the `sale_price` and numerous physical attributes of nearly 3,000 homes in Ames, Iowa in the early 2000s. To access this data, we first add the `AmesHousing` package to our library and create the nicely formatted data with the `make_ordinal_ames()` function. 


```{r results='hide', message=FALSE}
library(AmesHousing)

ames <- make_ordinal_ames() 
str(ames)
```

### Types of Variables {#vartypes}

The columns of a data set are referred to by the following __equivalent terms__:

</ul>
<li> Variables
<li> Features
<li> Attributes
<li> Predictors/Targets
<li> Factors
<li> Inputs/Outputs
</ul> 

This book may use any of these words interchangeably to refer to a quality or quantity of interest in our data. 

#### Nominal Variables {-}

A __nominal__ or __categorical variable__ is a _quality of interest_ whose values have no logical ordering.  Color ("blue", "red", "green"...), ethnicity ("African-American", "Asian", "Caucasian",...), and style of house ("ranch", "two-story", "duplex", ...) are all examples of nominal attributes. The categories or values that these variables can take on - those words listed in quotes and parenthesis - are called the __levels__ of the variable. 

In modeling, nominal attributes are commonly transformed into __dummy variables__. Dummy variables are binary columns that indicate the presence or absence of a quality. There is more than one way to create dummy variables, and the treatment will be different depending on what type of model you are using. Linear regression models will use either __reference-level__ or __effects coding__, whereas other machine learning models are more likely to use one-hot encoding or a variation thereof. 

__One-hot encoding__

For machine learning applications, it is common to create a binary dummy column for each level of your categorical variable. This is the most intuitive representation of categorical information, answering indicative questions for each level of the variable: _"is it blue?"_, _"is it red?"_ etc. The table below gives an example of some data, the original nominal variable (color) and the one-hot encoded color information. 

<table>
<tr>
<td> Observation<td> Color<td> Blue<td> Red<td> Yellow<td> Other
<tr><td> 1<td> Blue<td> 1<td> 0<td> 0<td> 0
<tr> <td> 2<td> Yellow<td> 0<td> 0<td> 1<td> 0
<tr><td> 3<td> Blue<td> 1<td> 0<td> 0<td> 0
<tr><td> 4<td> Red<td> 0<td> 1<td> 0<td> 0
<tr><td> 5<td> Red<td> 0<td> 1<td> 0<td> 0
<tr><td> 6<td> Blue<td> 1<td> 0<td> 0<td> 0
<tr> <td> 7<td> Yellow<td> 0<td> 0<td> 1<td> 0
<tr><td> 8<td> Other<td> 0<td> 0<td> 0<td> 1
</table>
<caption> (\#tab:onehot)One-hot dummy variable coding for the categorical attribute _color_ </caption>

We will demonstrate the creation of this data using some simple random categorical data:

```{r}
set.seed(41)
dat <- data.frame(y = c(rnorm(10,2), rnorm(10,1),rnorm(10,0)),
                x1 = factor(rep(c("A", "B", "C"), each = 10)),
                x2 = factor(rep(c("Z", "X", "Y","W","V","U"), each = 5)))
print(dat)
```
Unlike reference and effects coding, which are typically specified within the `lm()` function as we will see in Chapter \@ref(slr), one-hot encoding is most quickly achieved through use of the `onehot` package in R, which first creates an "encoder" to do the job quickly. 

The speed of this function has been tested against both the base R `model.matrix()` function and the `dummyVars()` function in the `caret` package and is _substantially_ faster than either. 
```{r message=FALSE}
library(onehot)

encoder  = onehot(dat)
dummies = predict(encoder,dat)
head(dummies)
```

__Reference-level coding __

Reference-level coding is similar to one-hot encoding except one of the levels of the attribute, called the __reference level__, is omitted. Notice that the 4 dummy columns from Table \@ref(tab:onehot) collectively form a linearly dependent set; that is, if you know the values of 3 of the 4 dummy variables you can determine the $4^{th}$ with complete certainty. This would be a problem for linear regression, where we assume our input attributes are not linearly dependent as we will discuss in Chapter \@ref(slr).  

A reference level of the attribute is often specified by the user to be a particular level worthy of comparison (a baseline), as the estimates in the regression output will be interpreted in a way that compares each non-reference level to the reference level. If a reference level is not specified by the user, one will be picked by the software by default either using the order in which the levels were encountered in the data, or their alphabetical ordering. Users should check the documentation of the associated function to understand what to expect.

Table \@ref(tab:refcoding) transforms the one-hot encoding from Table \@ref(tab:onehot) into reference-level coding with the color "blue" as the reference level. Notice the absence of the column indicating "blue" and how each blue observation exists as a row of zeros. 

<table>
<tr><td> Observation<td> Color<td> Red<td> Yellow<td> Other</tr>
<tr><td> 1<td> Blue<td> 0<td> 0<td> 0</tr>
<tr><td> 2<td> Yellow<td> 0<td> 1<td> 0</tr>
<tr><td> 3<td> Blue<td> 0<td> 0<td> 0</tr>
<tr><td> 4<td> Red<td> 1<td> 0<td> 0</tr>
<tr><td> 5<td> Red<td> 1<td> 0<td> 0</tr>
<tr><td> 6<td> Blue<td> 0<td> 0<td> 0</tr>
<tr><td> 7<td> Yellow<td> 0<td> 1<td> 0</tr>
<tr><td> 8<td> Other<td> 0<td> 0<td> 1</tr>
</table>
<caption> (\#tab:refcoding) Reference-level dummy variable coding for the categorical attribute _color_ and the reference level of "blue" </caption>

__Effects coding__

Effects coding is useful for obtaining a more general comparative interpretation when you have approximately equal sample sizes across each level of your categorical attribute. Effects coding is designed to allow the user to compare each level to _all_ of the other levels. More specifically the mean of each level is compared to the __overall mean__ of your data. However, the comparison is actually to the so-called _grand mean_, which is the mean of the means of each group. When sample sizes are equal, the grand mean and the overall sample mean are equivalent. When sample sizes are _not_ equal, the parameter estimates for effects coding should not be used for interpretation or explanation. 

Effects coding still requires a _reference level_, however the purpose of the reference level is not the same as it was in reference-level coding. Here, the reference level is left out in the sense that no comparison is made between it and the overall mean. Table \@ref(tab:effcoding) shows our same example with effects coding. Again we notice the absence of the column indicating "blue"  but now the reference level receives values of `-1` rather than `0` for all 3 dummy columns.  We will revisit the interpretation of linear regression coefficients under this coding scheme in Chapter \@ref(slr). 

<table>
<tr><td> Observation<td> Color<td> Red<td> Yellow<td> Other
<tr><td> 1<td> Blue<td> -1<td> -1<td> -1
<tr> <td> 2<td> Yellow<td> 0<td> 1<td> 0
<tr><td> 3<td> Blue<td> -1<td> -1<td> -1
<tr><td> 4<td> Red<td> 1<td> 0<td> 0
<tr><td> 5<td> Red<td> 1<td> 0<td> 0
<tr><td> 6<td> Blue<td> -1<td> -1<td> -1
<tr> <td> 7<td> Yellow<td> 0<td> 1<td> 0
<tr><td> 8<td> Other<td> 0<td> 0<td> 1
</table>
<caption> (\#tab:effcoding) Effects coding for the categorical attribute _color_ and the reference level of "blue" </caption>

#### Interval Variables {-}

An interval variable is a _quantity of interest_ on which the mathematical operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division can be performed. Time, temperature and age are all examples of interval attributes. To illustrate the definition, note that "15 minutes" divided by "5 minutes" is 3, which indicates that 15 minutes is 3 times as long as 5 minutes. The sensible interpretation of this simple arithmetic sentence demonstrates the nature of interval attributes. One should note that such arithmetic would not make sense in the treatment of nominal variables. 

#### Ordinal Variables {-}

__Ordinal variables__ are attributes that are qualitative in nature but have some natural ordering. _Level of education_ is a common example, with a level of 'PhD' indicating _more_ education than 'Bachelors' but lacking a numerical framework to quantify _how much more_. The treatment of ordinal variables will depend on the application. Survey responses on a Likert scale are also ordinal - a response of 4="somewhat agree" on a 1-to-5 scale of agreement cannot reliably be said to be twice as enthusiastic as a response of 2="somewhat disagree". These are not interval measurements, though they are often treated as such in a trade-off for computational efficiency. 

__Ordinal variables will either be given some numeric value and treated as interval variables or they will be treated as categorical variables and dummy variables will be created. The choice of solution is up to the analyst.__ When numeric values are assigned to ordinal variables, the possibilities are many. For example, consider _level of education_. The simplest ordinal treatment for such an attribute might be something like Table \@ref(tab:educationint).

<table>
<tr> <td> Level of Education <td> Numeric Value
<tr> <td> No H.S. Diploma <td> 1
<tr> <td> H.S. Diploma or GED <td> 2
<tr> <td> Associates or Certificate <td> 3
<tr> <td> Bachelors <td> 4
<tr> <td> Graduate Certificate <td> 5
<tr> <td> Masters <td> 6
<tr> <td> PhD <td> 7
</table>
<caption> (\#tab:educationint) One potential approach to scaling the ordinal attribute level of education </caption>

While numeric values have been assigned and this data _could_ be used like an interval attribute, it's important to realize that the notion of a "one-unit increase" is qualitative in nature rather than quantitative. However, if we're interested in learning whether there is a _linear_ type of relationship between education and another attribute (meaning as education level increases, the value of another attribute increases or decreases), this would be the path to get us there. However we're making an assumption in this model that the difference between a H.S. Diploma and an Associates degree (a difference of "1 unit") is the same as the difference between a Master's degree and a PhD (also a difference of "1 unit"). These types of assumptions can be flawed, and it is often desirable to develop an alternative system of measurement based either on domain expertise or the target variable of interest. This is the notion behind __optimal scaling__ and __target-level encoding__.

__Optimal Scaling__

The primary idea behind optimal scaling is to transform an ordinal attribute into an interval one in a way that doesn't restrict the numeric values to simply the integers $1,2,3, \dots$. It's reasonable for a data scientist to use domain expertise to develop an alternative scheme. 

For example, if analyzing movie theater concessions with ordinal drink sizes {small, medium, large}, one is not restricted to the numeric valuation of 1=small, 2=medium, and 3=large just because it's an ordinal variable with 3 levels. Perhaps it would make more sense to use the drink size in fluid ounces to represent the ordinality. If the small drink is 12 ounces, the medium is 20 ounces, and the large is 48 ounces, then using those values as the numerical representation would be every bit as (if not more) reasonable than using the standard integers 1, 2, and 3. 

If we re-consider the ordinal attribute level of education, we might decide to represent the approximate years of post-secondary  schooling required to obtain a given level. This might lead us to something like the attribute values in Table \@ref(tab:educationscaled).

<table>
<tr> <td> Level of Education <td> Numeric Value
<tr> <td> No H.S. Diploma <td> -1
<tr> <td> H.S. Diploma or GED <td> 0
<tr> <td> Associate's or Certificate <td> 2
<tr> <td> Bachelor's <td> 4
<tr> <td> Graduate Certificate <td> 5
<tr> <td> Master's <td> 6
<tr> <td> PhD <td> 8
</table>
<caption> (\#tab:educationscaled) One potential approach to scaling the ordinal attribute level of education </caption>

If we were modeling the effect of education on something like salary, it seems reasonable to assume that the jumps between levels should not have equal distance like they did in \@ref(tab:educationint). It seems reasonable to assume that one would experience a larger salary lift from Associate's to Bachelor's degree than they would from No H.S. Diploma to GED. The most common way to determine the numeric values for categories is to use information from the response variable. This is commonly referred to as __target level encoding__.

__Target Level Encoding__

The values in Table \@ref(tab:educationscaled) might have struck the reader as logical but arbitrary. To be more scientific about the determination of those numeric values, one might wish to use information from the response variable to obtain a more precise expected change in salary for each level increase in education. At first hearing this, one might question the validity of the technique; isn't the goal to _predict_ salary? This line of thought is natural, which is why having a holdout sample is extremely important in this situation. To implement Target level encoding, we can simply create a look-up table that matches each level of education to the average or median salary obtained for that level. These values can be used just as readily as the arbitrary levels created in Table \@ref(tab:educationscaled) to encode the ordinal attribute!

### Distributions {#dist}

After reviewing the types and formats of the data inputs, we move on to some basic __univariate__ (one variable at a time) analysis. We start by describing the distribution of values that each variable takes on. For nominal variables, this amounts to frequency tables and bar charts of how often each level of the variable appears in the data set.

We'll begin by exploring one of our nominal features, `Heating_QC` which categorizes the quality and condition of a home's heating system. To create plots in R, we will use the popular `ggplot2` library. At the same time, we will load the `tidyverse` library which we will use in the next chunk of code. 

```{r message=F,fig=T, fig.align='center', fig.cap = 'Distribution of Nominal Variable Heating_QC', label='barchart'}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(data = ames) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = Heating_QC),fill="orange") + labs(x="Heating System Quality",y="Frequency",title="Bar Graph of Heating System")
```
To summon the same information in tabular form, we can use the `count()` function to create a table:
```{r}
ames %>% 
  count(Heating_QC)
```
You'll notice that very few houses (3) have heating systems in `Poor` condition, and the majority of houses have systems rated `Excellent`. __It will likely make sense to combine the categories of `Fair` and `Poor` in our eventual analysis, a decision we will later revisit.__

Next we create a __histogram__ for an interval attribute like `Sale_Price`:

```{r message=F,label='histogram', fig.align='center', fig.cap = 'Distribution of Interval Variable Sale_Price'}
ggplot(data = ames) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = Sale_Price/1000),fill="blue") + 
  labs(x = "Sales Price (Thousands $)",y="Frequency",title="Histogram of Sales Price in Thousands of Dollars")
```

From this initial inspection, we can conclude that most of the houses sell for less than $200,000 and there are a number of expensive anomalies. To more concretely describe and quantify a statistical distribution, we use statistics that describe the _location, spread, and shape_ of the data.

#### Location {-}

The _location_ is a measure of central tendency for a distribution. Most common measures of central tendency are __mean__, __median__, and __mode__. 


We define each of these terms below for a variable $\mathbf{x}$ having n observations with values $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^n$, sorted in order of magnitude such that $x_1 \leq x_2 \leq \dots \leq x_n$:

<ul>
<li>  Mean: The __average__ of the observations, $\bar{\mathbf{x}}= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$
<li>  Median: The "middle value" of the data. Formally, when $n$ is odd, the median is the observation value, $x_m = x_{\frac{(n+1)}{2}}$ for which $x_i < x_m$ for 50% of the observations (excluding $x_m$). When $n$ is even, $x_m$ is the average of $x_\frac{n}{2}$ and $x_{(\frac{n}{2}+1)}$. The median is also known as the $2^{nd}$ __quartile__ (see next section).
<li>  Mode: The most commonly occurring value in the data. Most commonly used to describe nominal attributes.


__Example__

The following table contains the heights of 10 students randomly sampled from NC State's campus. Compute the mean, median, mode and quartiles of this variable.

<table style="width:auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" >
<tr><td style="text-align:center"> height 
<td style="text-align:center"> 60
<td style="text-align:center"> 62
<td style="text-align:center"> 63
<td style="text-align:center"> 65
<td style="text-align:center"> 67
<td style="text-align:center"> 67
<td style="text-align:center"> 67
<td style="text-align:center"> 68
<td style="text-align:center"> 68
<td style="text-align:center"> 69
</table>

__Solution:__

<ul>
<li> The mean is `(60+62+63+65+67+67+67+68+68+69)/10` = 65.6.
<li> The median (second quartile) is `(67+67)/2` = 67.
<li> The mode is 67.
</ul>

#### Spread {-}

Once we have an understanding of the central tendency of a data set, we move on to describing the spread (the dispersion or variation) of the data. __Range__, __interquartile range__, __variance__, and __standard deviation__ are all statistics that describe spread. 

<ul> 
<li> Range: The difference between the maximum and minimum data values.
<li> Sample variance: The sum of squared differences between each data point and the mean, divided by (n-1). $\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar{x})^2$
<li> Standard deviation: The square root of the sample variance. \


In order to define __interquartile range__, we must first define __percentiles__ and __quartiles__.

<li>  Percentiles: The 99 intermediate values of the data which divide the observations into 100 equally-sized groups.  The $r^{th}$ percentile of the data, $P_{r}$ is the number for which $r$% of the data is less than $P_{r}$.
<li>  Quartiles: The quartiles of the data are the $25^{th}$, $50^{th}$ and $75^{th}$ percentiles.  They are denoted as $Q_{1}$ ($1^{st}$ quartile), $Q_{2}$ ($2^{nd}$ quartile = median) and $Q_{3}$ ($3^{rd}$ quartile), respectively.
<li> Interquartile range (IQR): The difference between the $25^{th}$ and $75^{th}$ percentiles.



One should note that standard deviation is more frequently reported than variance because it shares the same units as the original data, and because of the guidance provided by the empirical rule. If we're exploring something like `Sale_Price`, which has the unit "dollars", then the variance would be measured in "square-dollars", which hampers the intuition. Standard deviation, on the other hand, would share the unit "dollars", aiding our fundamental understanding. 

__Example __
Let's again use the table of heights from the previous example, this time computing the range, IQR, sample variance and standard deviation.

<table style="width:auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" >
<tr><td style="text-align:center"> height 
<td style="text-align:center"> 60
<td style="text-align:center"> 62
<td style="text-align:center"> 63
<td style="text-align:center"> 65
<td style="text-align:center"> 67
<td style="text-align:center"> 67
<td style="text-align:center"> 67
<td style="text-align:center"> 68
<td style="text-align:center"> 68
<td style="text-align:center"> 69
</table>

__Solution:__

<ul>
<li> The range `69-60` = 9.
<li> The variance is `((60-65.6)^2+(62-65.6)^2+(63-65.6)^2+(65-65.6)^2+(67-65.6)^2+(67-65.6)^2+(67-65.6)^2+(68-65.6)^2+(68-65.6)^2+(69-65.6)^2)/9` = 8.933
<li> The standard deviation is `sqrt(8.933)` = 2.989
<li> The first quartile is `(62+63)/2` = 62.5
<li> The third quartile is `(68+68)/2` = 68
<li> The IQR is `68 - 62.5` = 5.5.
</ul>

#### Shape {-}

The final description we will want to give to distributions regards their shape. Is the histogram _symmetric_? Is it _unimodal_ (having a single large "heap" of data) or _multimodal_ (having multiple heaps")? Does it have a longer tail on one side than the other (_skew_)? Is there a lot more or less data in the tails than you might expect? 

We'll formalize these ideas with some illustrations. A distribution is right (left) skewed if it has a longer tail on its right (left) side, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:skewdiagram). 

```{r echo=F,label='skewdiagram', fig.align='center', fig.cap = 'Examples of Left-Skewed (Negative Skew) and Right-skewed (Positive Skew) distributions respectively', out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/skewdiagrams.png")
```

A distribution is called _bimodal_ if it has two "heaps", as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:bimodal). 


```{r label='bimodal', fig.align='center', fig.cap = 'Example of a Bimodal Distribution', echo=F, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/bimodal.png")
```

#### Summary Functions in R {-}

There are many ways to obtain all of the statistics described in the preceding sections, below we highlight 3:

<ol>
<li> The `describe` function from the `Hmisc` package which can work on the entire dataset or a subset of columns.
```{r message=FALSE}
library(Hmisc)

Hmisc::describe(ames$Sale_Price)
```

<li> The tidyverse `summarise` function, in this case obtaining statistics for each `Exter_Qual` separately.
```{r} 
library(tidyverse)
ames %>% group_by(Exter_Qual) %>% dplyr::summarise(average = mean(Sale_Price), st.dev = sd(Sale_Price), maximum = max(Sale_Price), minimum = min(Sale_Price))
```
<li> The base R `summary` function, which can work on the entire dataset or an individual variable
```{r} 
summary(ames$Sale_Price)
```

### The Normal Distribution {#normal}

The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is one of the most fundamental concepts in statistics. It is one that arises naturally out of many applications and settings. The normal distribution has the following characteristics:
<ol>
<li> Symmetric
<li> Fully defined by mean and standard deviation (equivalently, variance)
<li> Bell-shaped/Unimodal
<li> Mean = Median = Mode
<li> Assymptotic to the x-axis (theoretical bounds are $-\infty$ to $\infty$)
</ol>

Much of the normal distributions utility can be summarized in the __empirical rule__, which states that:

<ul> 
<li> $\approx$ 68% of data in normal distribution lies within 1 standard deviation of the mean. 
<li> $\approx$ 95% of data in normal distribution lies within 2 standard deviations of the mean. 
<li> $\approx$ 99.7% of data in normal distribution lies within 3 standard deviations of the mean. 
</ul>

We can thus conclude that observations found outside of 3 standard deviations from the mean are quite rare, expected less than 1% of the time. 

### Skewness {#skew}

Skewness is a statistic that describes the symmetry (or lack thereof) of a distribution. A normal distribution is perfectly symmetric and has a skewness of 0. Distributions that are more right skewed will have positive values of skewness whereas distributions that are more left skewed will have negative values of skewness. 

### Kurtosis {#kurt}

Kurtosis is a statistic that describes the _tailedness_ of a distribution. The normal distribution has a kurtosis of 3. Distributions that are more tailed (leptokurtic or heavy-tailed) will have kurtosis values greater than 3 whereas distributions that are more less tailed (platykurtic or thin-tailed) will have  values of kurtosis less than 3. For this reason, kurtosis is often reported in the form of _excess kurtosis_ which is the raw kurtosis value minus 3. This is meant as a comparison to the normal distribution so that positive values indicate thicker tails and negative values indicate thinner tails than the normal. 

In Figure \@ref(fig:kurtosis) below, we compare classical examples of leptokurtic and platykurtic distributions to a normal distribution with the same mean and variance. 

```{r label='kurtosis', echo=F,message=F, fig.align='center',fig.cap='The Laplace distribution (top left) is leptokurtic because it has more data in its tails than the normal distribution with the same mean and variance. The uniform distribution (top right) is platykurtic because it has less data in its tails than the normal distribution with the same mean and variance (it effectively has no tails).'}

### Graphical Displays of Distributions {#graphdist}

There are three types of plots for examining the distribution of your data values:
<ol>
<li> Histograms
<li> Normal Probability Plots (QQ-plots)
<li> Box Plots

#### Histograms {-}

A histogram shows the shape of a univariate distribution. Each bar in the histogram represents a group of values (a _bin_). The height of the bar represents the either the frequency of or the percent of values in the bin. The width and number of bins is determined automatically, but the user can adjust them to see more or less detail in the histogram. Figure \@ref(fig:histogram) demonstrated a histogram of sale price. Sometimes it's nice to overlay a continuous approximation to the underlying distribution using a _kernal density estimator_  with the `geom_density` plot, demonstrated in Figure \@ref(fig:histwithkernal).

```{r label='histwithkernal',fig.align='center',fig.cap='Histogram of Sale_Price with kernal density estimator', message=F} 
ggplot(ames,aes(x=Sale_Price/1000)) + 
    geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), alpha=0.5) + geom_density( alpha = 0.2) +
    labs(x = "Sales Price (Thousands $)")  

```

In our next example, Figure \@ref(fig:overhistogramAC), we'll complicate the previous example by showing _two_ distributions of sale price, one for each level of the binary variable `Central_Air`, overlaid on the same axes.

We can immediately see that there are many more houses that have central air than do not in this data. It appears as though the two distributions have different locations, with the purple distribution centered at a larger sale price. To normalize that quantity and compare the raw probability densitites, we can change our axes to density as in Figure \@ref(fig:overhistogramdensityAC).

```{r label='overhistogramAC',fig.align='center',fig.cap='Histogram: Frequency of Sale_Price for Each value of Central_Air', message=F} 
ggplot(ames,aes(x=Sale_Price/1000)) + 
    geom_histogram(data=subset(ames,Central_Air == 'Y'),aes(fill=Central_Air), alpha = 0.2) +
    geom_histogram(data=subset(ames,Central_Air == 'N'),aes(fill=Central_Air), alpha  = 0.2) +
    labs(x = "Sales Price (Thousands $)")  + scale_fill_manual(name="Central_Air",values=c("red","blue"),labels=c("No","Yes"))


```
```{r label='overhistogramdensityAC',fig.align='center',fig.cap='Histogram: Density of Sale_Price for varying qualities of  Central_Air'} 
ggplot(ames,aes(x=Sale_Price/1000)) + 
    geom_histogram(data=subset(ames,Central_Air == 'Y'),aes(y=..density..,fill=Central_Air), alpha = 0.2) +
    geom_histogram(data=subset(ames,Central_Air == 'N'),aes(y=..density..,fill=Central_Air), alpha = 0.2) +
    labs(x = "Sales Price (Thousands $)") 


```
To ease our differentiation of the histograms even further, we again employ a kernel density estimator as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:overhistogramdensitykernelAC). This is an appealing alternative to the histogram for continuous data that is assumed to originate from some smooth underlying distribution. 

```{r label='overhistogramdensitykernelAC',fig.align='center',fig.cap='Histogram: Density of Sale_Price for varying qualities of Central_Air', message=F} 
ggplot(ames,aes(x=Sale_Price/1000)) + 
    geom_density(data=subset(ames,Central_Air == 'Y'),aes(fill=Central_Air), alpha = 0.2) +
    geom_density(data=subset(ames,Central_Air == 'N'),aes(fill=Central_Air), alpha = 0.2) +
    labs(x = "Sales Price (Thousands $)")  

```


#### Normal probability plots (QQ Plots) {-}

A __normal probability plot__ graphs the sorted data values against the values that one would expect if the same number of observations came from a theoretical normal distribution. The resulting image would look close to a straight line if the data was generated by a normal distribution. Strong deviations from a straight line indicate that the data distribution is not normal. 

Figure \@ref(fig:qqplot) shows a QQ plot for `Sale_Price`, and we can conclude that the variable is not normally distributed (in fact it is right skewed). 

```{r label='qqplot',fig.align='center',fig.cap='QQ-Plot: Quantiles of Sale_Price vs. quantiles of a theoretical normal distribution with same mean and standard deviation. Conclusion: Sale_Price is _not_ normally distributed due to a problem with skew.'}
ggplot(data = ames, aes(sample = Sale_Price/1000)) +
  stat_qq() +
  stat_qq_line()
```
There are two main patterns that we expect to find when examining QQ-plots: 
<ol>
<li> A quadratic shape, as seen in Figure \@ref(fig:qqplot). This pattern indicates a deviation from normality due to skewness to the data. 
<li> An S-shape (or cubic shape), as seen in Figure \@ref(fig:qqplotKurt). This pattern indicates deviation from normality due to kurtosis.
</ol>
```{r label='qqplotKurt',fig.align='center',fig.cap='QQ-Plot: Quantiles of the Laplace distribution vs. quantiles of a theoretical normal distribution with same mean and standard deviation. Conclusion: Data is _not_ normally distributed (in fact it is leptokurtic), due to a problem with kurtosis.'}
df <- data.frame(j1 = rlaplace(10000,0,1))

ggplot(data = df, aes(sample=j1)) +
  stat_qq() +
  stat_qq_line()
```
#### Box Plots {-}

Box plots (sometimes called box-and-whisker plots) will not necessarily tell you about the _shape_ of your distribution (for instance a bimodal distribution could have a similar box plot to a unimodal one), but it will give you a sense of the distribution's location and spread and potential skewness. 

Many of us have become familiar with the _idea_ of a box plot, but when pressed for the specific steps to create one, we realize our familiarity fades. The diagram in Figure \@ref(fig:boxplot) will remind the reader the precise information conveyed by a box plot. 

```{r label='boxplot',fig.align='center',fig.cap='Anatomy of a Box Plot.',echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("img/boxplot.png")
```

Figure \@ref(fig:rboxplot) shows the boxplot of `Sale_Price`.

```{r label='rboxplot',fig.align='center',fig.cap='Box Plot of Sales Price'}
ggplot(data = ames, aes(y = Sale_Price/1000)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(y = "Sales Price (Thousands $)")
```  

Furthermore, we might want to compare the boxplots of `Sale_Price` for different levels of a categorical variable, like `Central_Air` as we did with histograms and densities in Figures \@ref(fig:overhistogramAC) and \@ref(fig:overhistogramdensityAC).

The following code achieves this goal in Figure \@ref(fig:multiboxplotAC).


```{r label='multiboxplotAC',fig.align='center',fig.cap='Box Plots of Sale_Price for each level of Exter_Qual'}
ggplot(data = ames, aes(y = Sale_Price/1000, x = Central_Air, fill = Central_Air)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(y = "Sales Price (Thousands $)", x = "Central Air") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Accent") + theme_classic() + coord_flip()
```  


## Point Estimates {#pointest}

All the statistics discussed so far have been _point estimates_. They are our _best_ estimate at what the population parameter might be, but since we've taken a random sample of data from that population, there must be some uncertainty surrounding that estimate. In statistics, our real interest lies in drawing inferences about an entire population (which we couldn't possibly observe due to time, cost, and/or feasibility constraints) and our approach is to take a representative sample and try to understand what it might tell us about the population. 

For the remainder of this text, we will assume our sample is representative of the population. Let's review some common statistical notation of _population parameters_ (the true values we are unable to observe) and _sample statistics_ (those values we calculate based on our sample)

| Population Parmeter             |Sample Statistic           |
|:------------------------------------:|:---------------------------:|
|Mean ($\mu$)                          |Sample Average($\bar{x}$)   |
|Variance ($\sigma^{2}$)               |Sample Variance($s^{2}_{x}$)|
|Standard deviation ($\sigma^{2}$)     |Sample standard deviation($s_{x}$)|



Calculating point estimates should lead us to a natural question, one that embodies the field of statistics which aims to quantify uncertainty: _What's the margin of error for this estimate? _
This will be the subject of interest in the next section. 


## Confidence Intervals {#ci}

Let's imagine that we want to calculate the average gas mileage of American cars on the road today in order to analyze the country's carbon footprint. It should be clear to the reader that the calculation of the _population mean_ would not be possible. The best we could do is take a large representative sample and calculate the sample average. Again, the next question should be: What is the margin of error for this estimate? If our sample average is 21.1 mpg, could the population mean reasonably be 21.2 mpg? how about 25 mpg? 42 mpg? 

To answer this question, we reach for the notion of _confidence intervals_. A __confidence interval__ is an interval that we believe contains the population mean with some degree of confidence. A confidence interval is associated with a _confidence level_, a percentage, which indicates the strength of our confidence that the interval created actually captured the true parameter. 

It's an important nuance to remember that the population mean is a fixed number. The source of randomness in our estimation is our sample. When we construct a 95% confidence interval, we are claiming that, upon repetition of the sampling and interval calculation process, we expect 95% of our created intervals to contain the population mean. 

To obtain a confidence interval for a mean in R, we can use the `t.test()` function, as shown below.

```{r}
t.test(ames$Sale_Price, conf.level = 0.95)
```

We can gather based on the output that our 95% confidence interval for the mean of `Sale_Price` is [177902.3, 183689.9]. This function also outputs some extra information that relates to hypothesis testing which we will discuss in Section \@ref(hypotest). For now, if we only want to pull the output containing the confidence interval information, we can specify `$conf.int` to the object output from `t.test`:

```{r}
t.test(ames$Sale_Price, conf.level = 0.95)$conf.int
```

To learn the labels of the various pieces of output, you can list them with the `ls()` function, or by saving the output as an object (below, `results` is the object that stores the output) and exploring it in your environment (upper right panel in RStudio):

```{r}
ls(t.test(ames$Sale_Price, conf.level = 0.95))

results <- t.test(ames$Sale_Price, conf.level = 0.95)
```

## Hypothesis Testing {#hypotest}

A confidence interval can help us test a hypothesis about the population mean. A __hypothesis__ is merely a statement that we wish to investigate scientifically through the process of statistical inference. In Section \@ref(ci) we proposed some potential hypotheses in the form of questions: If the sample average gas mileage is 21.1, is it possible that the population mean is 21.2? How about 42? The statistical __hypothesis test__ can help us answer these questions.

To conduct a hypothesis test, we make an initial assumption. This initial assumption is called the __null hypothesis__ and typically denoted as $H_0$. We then analyze the data and determine whether our observations are likely, given our assumption of the null hypothesis. If we determine that our observed data was unlikely _enough_ (beyond some threshold that we set before hand - or beyond a "reasonable doubt" in the justice system) then we _reject_ our initial assumption in favor of the opposite statement, known as the __alternative hypothesis__ denoted $H_a$. The threshold or __significance level__ that we use to determine how much evidence is required to reject the null hypothesis is a proportion, $\alpha$, which specifies how often we're willing to incorrectly reject the null hypothesis (this means that we are assuming the null hypothesis is true). Remember, in applied statistics there are no proofs. Every decision we make comes with some degree of uncertainty. $\alpha$ quantifies our allowance for that uncertainty. In statistical textbooks of years past, $\alpha = 0.05$ was the norm. Later in this text we will propose much smaller values for $\alpha$ depending on your sample size. 

In order to quantify how unlikely it was that we observed a statistic as extreme or more extreme than we did, we calculate a __p-value__. The p-value is the area under the __null distribution__ that represents the probability that we observed something as extreme or more extreme than we did (assuming the truth of the null hypothesis). If our p-value is less than our confidence level, $\alpha$, we have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative. 

Let's take an example and actually _create_ a null distribution. Suppose we flip a fair coin, having equal probability of landing on heads or tails. We can actually simulate this experience with code! The following line of code does just that. Go ahead and run it a few times until you observe a coin flip of each type. 

```{r}
sample(c('Heads','Tails'), 1)
```

Now, let's suppose we do that _many_ times and count the number of times we observe one outcome, say `Heads`. This can be done by sampling the values directly into a vector. Let `n` be the number of coin tosses.

```{r}
n=100
outcomes = sample(c('Heads','Tails'), n, replace=T)
```

We can count the number of `Heads` we obtained as follows:

```{r}
sum(outcomes=="Heads")
```
Every time you run the lines of code above you will find a different set of coin flips and a varying number of `Heads`; _however_ the number of `Heads` will revolve around 50, because that is what we'd expect for a fair coin whose probability of `Heads` is 50% (Indeed, this simulates a draw from a binomial distribution with n=100 and p=0.5; the expected value of that distribution is $np=50$ and the variance is $np(1-p)=25$).  

Thus, if were to do the above experiment thousands of times, we could map out a distribution of how many `Heads` one might reasonably receive by tossing a fair coin 100 times. Let's do that, using a `for` loop. Let `T` be the number of simulated experiments (each experiment tosses the coin 100 times), and let `number_heads` be a vector that stores the number of heads for each experiment. We can initialize `number_heads` with an empty vector. Notice that our loop overwrites the coin toss data in each step, after recording the number of heads.

```{r label='cointoss', fig.align='center', fig.cap = 'Null Distribution: Number of heads for fair coin tossed 100 times '}
T=10000
n=100
set.seed(11)
number_heads = vector()
for(i in 1:T){
outcomes = sample(c('Heads','Tails'), n, replace=T)
number_heads[i] = sum(outcomes=="Heads")
}

df = data.frame(number_heads)

ggplot(data = df) +
  geom_density(aes(x = number_heads)) + 
  labs(x = "Number of heads in 100 tosses")
```

Figure \@ref(fig:cointoss) represents our null distribution of the number of heads from a fair coin tossed 100 times.  What are the minimum and maximum values of this observed distribution? 
```{r}
summary(df$number_heads)
```

***

__Example__ 

Suppose now we obtain a new coin from a friend and our hypothesis is that it "feels unfair". We decide that we want a conservative signficance level of 0.01 before we accuse our friend of cheating, so we conduct a hypothesis test. Our null hypothesis must generate a known distribution to which we can compare. Thus our null hypothesis is that the coin is fair:
$$H_0 = \text{The coin is fair:}\quad P(Heads) = 0.5$$
Our alternative hypothesis is the opposite of this:
$$H_0 = \text{The coin is not fair:}\quad P(Heads) \neq 0.5$$
Suppose we flip the coin 100 times and count 65 heads. How likely is it that we would have obtained a result as extreme or more extreme than this if the coin was fair? Here we introduce the notion of a __two-tailed hypothesis test__. Since our hypothesis is that the coin is simply unfair, we want to know how likely it is that we obtained a result _so different from 50_. This is quantified by the _absolute_ difference between what we observed and what we expected. Thus, when considering our null distribution, we want to look at the probability we'd obtain something greater than or equal to 65 ($=50+15$) heads, _or_ less than or equal to 35 ($=50-15$) heads. 

Let's take a look at this graphically through our simulated data:
```{r label='cointossht',echo=F, fig.align='center', fig.cap = 'Null Distribution: Number of heads for fair coin tossed 100 times '}
plot=ggplot(data = df) +
  geom_density(aes(x = number_heads)) + geom_vline(xintercept = 35, linetype="dotted", 
                color = "red", size=1.25)+ geom_vline(xintercept = 65, linetype="dotted", 
                color = "red", size=1.25)+labs(x = "Number of heads in 100 tosses")

area.data <- ggplot_build(plot)$data[[1]]
plot + 
  geom_area(data=area.data[which(area.data$x <= 35),], aes(x=x, y=y), fill="red") +
  geom_area(data=area.data[which(area.data$x >= 65),], aes(x=x, y=y), fill="red")
```
We can use this simulated distribution to estimate the p-value associated with obtaining 65 heads (the red area highlighted in Figure \@ref(fig:cointossht). We'd simply calculate the proportion of times we observed values equal to or more extreme than 65 - this is the very definition of a p-value. In the following line of code, `|` represents the logical "or" operator.
```{r}
sum(number_heads>=65 | number_heads<=35)/T
```
__Conclusion__: We said at the outset that we wanted a significance level of 0.01, or 1%, for our test before we accused our friend of cheating. Based on our simulations, there is a 0.4% chance that we'd obtain the result we did, or something more extreme, if the coin was fair. Therefore, we have no choice but to _reject our null hypothesis in favor of the alternative_. Our friend has some explaining to do!

Before we move on, we can compare the simulated result we just developed to one based on a theoretical distribution. This can be done using the ```prop.test()``` function to test a proportion. The formal test confirms our conclusion. 

```{r}
prop.test(65, 100, p = 0.5,
           alternative = c("two.sided"),
           conf.level = 0.99)
```
***

The nice thing about a simulation study like the one above is that it allows the user to explore how changes in the underlying procedure might affect the outcome. We'll next consider two pieces that of the simulation study and how they affect the p-value: the _sample size_ (the number of coin flips) and the _effect size_ (the observed deviation from 50% heads). 
<ol>
<li> What happens if we increase/decrease the number of coin flips in our experiment, but keep the effect size the same, fixed at 65% heads? If we only flipped the coin 10 times, would 6-7 heads be improbable to witness from a fair coin? If we flipped the coin 1000 times, would 650 heads be _more_ or _less_ improbable than that same ratio in 10 tosses? In other words, which of these situations would entail a smaller p-value? We hope that the reader now has some intuition to answer this question. If not, we encourage them to answer it by altering the value of `n` in the simulation code, and seeing how the changes affect the distribution of the null hypothesis. 
<li> What happens if we fix the sample size at 100 tosses and decrease the effect size from 65 heads to 60 heads? We've already generated the data to answer this question - our p-value would _increase_ because it would be _more_ probable to obtain a smaller effect size from a fair coin. On the flip side (pun intended) the p-value would _decrease_ for a larger effect size. 
 
### One-Sample T-Test {#onesample}

If we want to test whether the mean of continuous variable is equal to hypothesized value, we can use the `t.test()` function. The following code tests whether the average sale price of homes from Ames, Iowa over the data time period is \$178,000. For now, we'll use the classic $\alpha=0.05$ as our significance level. If we have enough evidence to reject this null hypothesis, we will conclude that the mean sale price is significantly different than \$178,000 for a two-tailed test (the default):


```{r}
t.test(ames$Sale_Price, mu = 178000)
```
Because our _p-value is greater than our alpha_ level of 0.05, we _fail to reject_ the null hypothesis. We do not quite have sufficient evidence to say the mean is different from 178,000.

If we're instead interested in testing whether the `Sale_Price` is _higher_ than \$178,000, we can specify this in the `alternative=` option. 
```{r}
t.test(ames$Sale_Price, mu = 178000, alternative = 'greater')
```
In this second test, we see that we actually _do have enough evidence_ to claim that the true mean is greater than \$178,000 at the $\alpha=0.05$ level.

## Two-Sample t-tests

If we have a hypothesis about a difference in the means of two groups of observations, a __two-sample t-test__ can tell us whether that difference is statistically significant. By _statistically significant_, we mean the observed difference in sample means is greater than what we would expect to find if the population means were truly equal. In other words, statistical significance is a phrase that describes when our p-value falls below our significance level, $\alpha$. Typically, the groups of interest are formed by levels of a binary variable, and the t-test is a way of testing whether there is a relationship between that binary variable and the continuous variable. 

To conduct a two-sample t-test, our data should satisfy 3 fundamental assumptions:
<ol>
<li> The observations are independent
<li> The data from each group is normally distributed
<li> The variances for each group are equal 
</ol>

If our data does not satisfy these assumptions, we must adapt our test to the situation. If the $3^{rd}$ assumption of equal variances is not met, we simply add the option `var.equal=F` to the `t.test()` function to use the Welch or Satterthwaite approximation to degrees of freedom (it's becoming increasingly common for practitioners to use this option even when variances are equal). 

If the $2^{nd}$ assumption is not met, one must opt for a _nonparametric_ test like the Mann-Whitney-U test (also called the Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon or the Wilcoxon rank-sum test).

The $1^{st}$ assumption is not easily checked unless the data is generated over time (time-series) and is instead generally implied by careful data collect and the application of domain expertise.

### Testing Normality of Groups {#testnorm}

We can test the normality assumption either graphically or through formal statistical tests. The best graphical test of normality is a QQ-Plot, though histograms are often used as well. We saw in Figures \@ref(fig:qqplot) and \@ref(fig:histogram) that the distribution of `Sale_Price` was not perfectly normal, however the deviations from normality were not egregious. In Figure \@ref(fig:qqplotcentralair) we again examine the normality of Sale Price, this time for each value of `Central_Air`:

```{r label='qqplotcentralair',fig.align='center',fig.cap="QQ-Plot: Quantiles of Sale_Price vs. quantiles of a theoretical normal distribution with same mean and standard deviation, for each level of Central_Air. Conclusion: Sale_Price is _not_ normally distributed for Central_Air='Yes' and is _more_ normally distributed for Central_Air = 'No'."}
ggplot(data = ames, aes(sample = Sale_Price, color = Central_Air)) +
     stat_qq() +
     stat_qq_line()
```


For formal tests of normality, we most often use the Shapiro-Wilk test, although many other formal tests exist, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. All of these tests have the null hypothesis of normality:
$$H_0: \text{ the data is normally distributed}$$
$$H_a: \text{ the data is NOT normally distributed}$$
We conduct formal tests as follows:

```{r}
shapiro.test(ames$Sale_Price[ames$Central_Air=='Y'])
shapiro.test(ames$Sale_Price[ames$Central_Air=='N'])
```
The formal test rejects the null hypotheses of normality and confirms what we saw in our visual analysis.

For the sake of illustration, we will proceed in this example under the assumption of normality (JUST for illustration), though a non-parametric approach will also be demonstrated later in our analysis in Section \@ref(wilcoxon). 

### Testing Equality of Variances {#ftest}

We can conduct a formal test to confirm that the $3^{rd}$ assumption is met. This test for equal variances is known as an F-Test. The null hypothesis is that the variances are equal, the alternative being that they are not:
$$H_0: \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2$$
$$H_a: \sigma_1^2 \neq \sigma_2^2$$

The F-Test is invoked with the `var.test` function, which takes as input a `formula`. A formula is an R object most often created using the `~` operator, for example `y ~ x + z`, interpreted as a specification that the response `y` is to be predicted with the inputs `x` and `z`.  For our present discussion on two-sample t-tests, we might think of predicting our continuous attribute with our binary attribute, provided the means are different between the two groups. 

The following code checks whether the distributions of Sale_Price for houses with and without central air have the same variance. 

```{r}
var.test(Sale_Price ~ Central_Air, data = ames)
```
They do not. Thus, we must opt for the `var.equal=FALSE` option in the `t.test()` procedure.

### Testing Equality of Means {#tsttest}

Assuming the first two assumptions are met, the two-sample t-test is performed by including a binary grouping variable with into the `t.test()` function. Below we test whether the mean sales price is different for houses with and without `Central_Air`, and we include the `var.equal=FALSE` option because we determined that the variances of the two groups were unequal in Section \@ref(ftest). The null hypothesis for the t-test is that the means of the two groups are equal:
$$H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2$$
$$H_a: \mu_1 \neq \mu_2$$

```{r}
t.test(Sale_Price ~ Central_Air, data = ames, var.equal = FALSE)
```

Our final conclusion from the t-test is the _rejection of the null hypothesis_ and the conclusion that _houses with and without central air should be expected to sell for different prices. _

### Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test {#wilcoxon}

As we pointed out in Section \@ref(testnorm), the distribution of `Sale_Price` was not precisely normal. The most principled way to proceed in this case would be with a non-parametric test. The Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test is not identical to the t-test in its null and alternative hypotheses, but it aims to answer the same question about an association between the binary attribute and the continuous attribute.

The null and alternative hypotheses for this test are typically defined as follows, so long as the two groups _are_ identically distributed (having the same _shape_ and variance):
$$H_0: \text{ the medians of the two groups are equal }  $$
$$H_a: \text{ the medians of the two groups are NOT equal }   $$
If those identical distributions are also symmetric, then Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon can be interpretted as testing for a difference in means. When the data is not identically distributed, or when the distributions are not symmetric, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon is a test of __dominance__ between distributions. __Distributional dominance__ is the notion that one group's distribution is located at larger values than another, probabilistically speaking.  Formally, a random variable A has dominance over random variable B if $P(A x) \geq P(B\geq x)$ for all $x$, and for some $x$, $P(A\geq x) > P(B\geq x)$.

We summarize this information in the following table:

<table style="width:auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<tr> <td> Conditions <td> Interpretation of Significant <br> Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test 
<tr> <td> Group distributions are identical in shape,<br> variance, and symmetric <td> Difference in means 
<tr> <td> Group distributions are identical in shape,<br> variance, but not symmetric <td> Difference in medians 
<tr> <td> Group distributions are identical in shape,<br> variance, but not symmetric <td> Difference in location. <br> (distributional dominance) </tr>
</table>

To perform this test, we use the `wilcox.test()` function, whose inputs are identical to the `t.test()` function.

```{r}
wilcox.test(Sale_Price ~ Central_Air, data = ames)
```
Thus, we make the same conclusion with our non-parametric test. Houses with and without central air should be expected to sell for different prices.

      <li> Inference
</ul>

In this chapter, we introduce one of the most commonly used tools in data science: the linear model. We'll start with some basic terminology. A __linear model__ is an equation that typically takes the form 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1\mathbf{x_1} + \dots + \beta_k\mathbf{x_k} + \boldsymbol \varepsilon 
(\#eq:linmod)
\end{equation}

The left-hand side of this equation, $\mathbf{y}$ is equivalently called the __target__, __response__, or __dependent__ variable. The right-hand side is a linear combination of the columns $\{\mathbf{x_i}\}_{i=1}^{k}$ which are commonly referred to as __explanatory__, __input__, __predictor__, or __independent__ variables. 

## Prediction vs. Explanation {#evp}

The purpose of a linear model like Equation \@ref(eq:linmod) is generally two-fold: 
<ol>
<li> The model is __predictive__ in that it can estimate the value of $y$ for a given combination of the $x$ attributes.
<li> The model is __explanatory__ in that it can estimate how $y$ changes for a unit increase in a given $x$ attribute, holding all else constant (via the slope parameters $\beta$).

However, it's common for _one_ of these purposes to be more aligned with the specific goals of your project, and it is common to approach the building of such a model differently for each purpose. 

In predictive modeling, you are most interested in how much error your model has on _holdout data_, that is, validation or test data. This is a notion that we introduce next in Section \@ref(trainvalidtest). If good predictions are all you want from your model, you are unlikely to care how many variables (including polynomial and interaction terms) are included in the final model.

In explanatory modeling, you foremost want a model that is simple to interpret and doesn't have too many input variables. It's common to avoid many polynomial and interaction terms for explanatory models. While the error rates on holdout data will still be useful reporting metrics for explanatory models, it will be more important to craft the model for ease of interpretation. 

## Honest Assessment {#trainvalidtest}

When performing predictive or explanatory modeling, we _always_ divide our data into subsets for training, validation, and/or final testing. Because models are prone to discovering small, spurious patterns on the data that is used to create them (the _training data_), we set aside the _validation_ and _testing data_ to get a clear view of how they might perform on new data that they've never seen before.  This is a concept that will be revisited several times throughout this text, highlighting its importance to honest assessment of models. 

There is no single right answer for how this division should occur for every data set - the answer depends on a multitude of factors that are beyond the scope of our present discussion. Generally speaking, one expects to keep about 70% of the data for model training purposes, and the remaining 30% for validation and testing. These proportions may change depending on the amount of data available. If one has millions of observations, they can often get away with a much smaller proportion of training data to reduce computation time and increase confidence in validation. If one has substantially fewer observations, it may be necessary to increase the training proportion in order to build a sound model - trading validation confidence for proper training. 

Below we demonstrate one technique for separating the data into just two subsets: training and test. These two subsets will suffice for our analyses in this text. We'll use 70% of our data for the training set and the remainder for testing. 

Since we are taking a random sample, each time you run this functions you will get a different result. This can be difficult for team members who wish to keep their analyses in sync. To avoid that variation of results, we can provide a "seed" to the internal random number generation process, which ensures that the randomly generated output is the same to all who use that seed. 

The following code demonstrates sampling via the `tidyverse`. This method requires the use of an id variable. If your data set has a unique identifier built in, you may omit the first line of code (after `set.seed()`) and use that unique identifier in the third line.

```{r  message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

set.seed(123)

ames <- ames %>% mutate(id = row_number())

train <- ames %>% sample_frac(0.7)

test <- anti_join(ames, train, by = 'id')

dim(train)
dim(test)
```
<!-- <li> Sampling via old-fashioned local indexing. This method creates a logical vector (containing the values `TRUE` or `FALSE`) that indicates the training set observations. The opposite vector, `!train_obs` then indicates the test set. The benefit of this method is the storage of this vector that permanently identifies which observations were placed in the training set.  -->
<!-- ```{r eval=F} -->
<!-- set.seed(1234) -->
<!-- train_obs = sample(c(T,F), nrow(ames),replace=T, prob = c(70,30)) -->
<!-- train = ames[train_obs, ] -->
<!-- test = ames[!train_obs, ] -->

<!-- dim(train) -->
<!-- dim(test) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- </ol> -->
<!-- It's important to note that _even with the same seed_, these two methods will not produce the same result as the randomization contained within them is fundamentally different.  -->

## Bivariate EDA

As stated in Chapter \@ref(intro-stat), exploratory data analysis is the foundation of any successful data science project. As we move on to the discussion of modeling, we begin to explore _bivariate_ relationships in our data. In doing so, we will often explore the input variables' relationships with the target. __Such exploration should only be done on the training data; we should never let insights from the validation or test data inform our decisions about modeling.__

Bivariate exploratory analysis is often used to assess relationships between two variables. An __association__ or __relationship__ exists when the expected value of one variable changes at different levels of the other variable. A __linear relationship__ between two continuous variables can be inferred when the general shape of a scatter plot of the two variables is a straight line. 

### Continuous-Continuous Associations

Let's conduct a preliminary assessment of the relationship between the size of the house in square feet (via `Gr_Liv_Area`) and the `Sale_Price` by creating a scatter plot (only on the training data). Note that we call this a preliminary assessment because we should not declare a statistical relationship without a formal hypothesis test (see Section \@ref(cor)). 

```{r label='scatterplot',fig.align='center',fig.cap='Scatter plot demonstrating a positive linear relationship'} 
ggplot(data = train) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Gr_Liv_Area, y = Sale_Price/1000)) +
  labs(y = "Sales Price (Thousands $)", x = "Greater Living Area (Sqft)")
```


###  Continuous-Categorical Associations

We'll also revisit the plots that we created in Section \@ref(eda), this time being careful to use only our training data since our goal is eventually to use a linear model to predict `Sale_Price`.

We start by exploring the relationship between the external quality rating of the home (via the ordinal variable `Exter_Qual` and the `Sale_Price`).

The simplest graphic we may wish to create is a bar chart like Figure \@ref(fig:barsale) that shows the average sale price of homes with each value of exterior quality.

```{r fig=T, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Bar Chart Comparing Average Sale Price of Homes with each Level of Exterior Quality', label='barsale'}
ggplot(train) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x=Exter_Qual,y= Sale_Price), 
           position = "dodge", stat = "summary", fun = "mean") +                                      
  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) format(x, scientific = FALSE)) # Modify formatting of axis
```

This gives us the idea that there may be an association between these two attributes, but it can be tricky to rely solely on this graph without exploring the overall distribution in sale price for each group. While this chart is great for the purposes of _reporting_ (once we've verified the relationship), it's not the best one for exploratory analysis. The next two charts allow us to have much more information on one graphic. 

The frequency histogram in Figure \@ref(fig:overhistogram) allows us to see that much fewer of the homes have a rating of `Excellent` versus the other tiers, a fact that makes it difficult to compare the distributions.  To normalize that quantity and compare the raw probability densities, we can change our axes to density (which is analogous to percentage) and employ a kernel density estimator with the `geom_density` plot as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:overhistogramdensitykernel). We can then clearly see that as the exterior quality of the home "goes up" (in the ordinal sense, not in the linear sense), the sale price of the home also increases.

```{r label='overhistogram',fig.align='center',fig.cap='Histogram: Frequency of Sale_Price for varying qualities of home exterior'} 
ggplot(train,aes(x=Sale_Price/1000, fill=Exter_Qual)) + 
  geom_histogram(alpha=0.2, position="identity") + 
  labs(x = "Sales Price (Thousands $)") 


```



```{r label='overhistogramdensitykernel',fig.align='center',fig.cap='Histogram: Density of Sale_Price for varying qualities of home exterior'} 
ggplot(ames,aes(x=Sale_Price/1000, fill=Exter_Qual)) + 
  geom_density(alpha=0.2, position="identity") + 
  labs(x = "Sales Price (Thousands $)")
    
  
    
```

To further explore the location and spread of the data, we can create box-plots for each group using the following code:

```{r label='multiboxplot',fig.align='center',fig.cap='Box Plots of Sale_Price for each level of Exter_Qual'}
ggplot(data = train, aes(y = Sale_Price/1000, x = `Exter_Qual`, fill = `Exter_Qual`)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(y = "Sales Price (Thousands $)", x = "Exterior Quality Category") +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", shape = 20, size = 5, color = "red", fill = "red") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Blues") + theme_classic() + coord_flip()
```  
Notice that we've highlighted the mean on each box-plot for the purposes of comparison. We now have a hypothesis that we may want to formally test. After all, it is not good practice to look at Figures \@ref(fig:overhistogramdensitykernel) and \@ref(fig:multiboxplot) and _declare_ that a statistical difference exists. While we do, over time, get a feel for which visually apparent relationships turn out to be statistically significant, it's _imperative_ that we conduct formal testing before declaring such insights to a colleague or stakeholder. 

If we want to test whether the `Sale_Price` is different for the different values of `Exter_Qual`, we have to reach for the multi-group alternative to the 2-sample t-test. This is called __Analysis of Variance__, or __ANOVA__ for short. 

## One-Way ANOVA {#oneway}

__One-way ANOVA__ aims to determine whether there is a difference in the mean of a continuous attribute across levels of a categorical attribute. Sound like a two-sample t-test? Indeed, it's the extension of that test to more than two groups. Performing ANOVA with a binary input variable is mathematically identical to the two-sample t-test, as are it's __assumptions__:

<ol>
<li> The observations are independent
<li> The model residuals are normally distributed
<li> The variances for each group are equal 
</ol>

A one-way ANOVA refers to a single hypothesis test, which is $H_{0}: \mu_{1}=\mu_{2}=...\mu_{k}$ for a predictor variable with $k$ levels against the alternative of at least one difference. Although a one-way ANOVA is designed to assess whether or not there is a significant difference within the mean values of the response with respect to the different levels of the predictor variable, we can draw some parallel to the regression model.  For example, if we have $k$=4, then we can let \(x_a\), \(x_b\), and \(x_c\) be 3 reference-coded dummy variables for the levels: `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. Note that we only have 3 dummy variables because one gets left out for the reference level, in this case it is `d`. The linear model is of the following form:

\begin{equation}
y=\beta_0 + \beta_ax_a+\beta_bx_b+\beta_cx_c + \varepsilon (\#eq:anova1) 
\end{equation}

If we define $x_a$ as 1 if the observation belongs to level `a` and 0 otherwise, and the same definition for $x_b$ and $x_c$, then this is called _reference-level coding_ (this will change for effects-level coding). The predicted values in \@ref(eq:anova1) is basically the predicted mean of the response within the 4 levels of the predictor variable.  
<ul>
<li> $\beta_0$ represents the mean of reference group, group `d`. 
<li> $\beta_a, \beta_b, \beta_c$ all represent the _difference_ in the respective group means compared to the reference level. Positive values thus reflect a group mean that is higher than the reference group, and negative values reflect a group mean lower than the reference group. 
<li> $\varepsilon$ is called the __error__. 
</ul>

A _one-way_ ANOVA model only contains a single input variable of interest. Equation \@ref(eq:anova1), while it has 3 dummy variable inputs, only contains a single nominal attribute. In \@ref(mlr), we will add more inputs to the equation via two-way ANOVA and multivariate regression models. 

ANOVA is used to test the following hypothesis:
$$H_0: \beta_a=\beta_b=\beta_c = 0 \quad\text{(i.e. all group means are equal)}$$
$$H_0: \beta_a\neq0\mbox{ or }\beta_b\neq0 \mbox{ or } \beta_c \neq 0 \quad\text{(i.e. at least one is different)}$$
Both the `lm()` function and the `aov()` function will provide the p-values to test the hypothesis above, the only difference between the two functions is that `lm()` will also provide the user with the coefficient of determinination, $R^2$, which tells you how much of the variation in $y$ is accounted for by your categorical input. 

```{r }

ames_lm <- lm(Sale_Price ~ Exter_Qual, data = train)

anova(ames_lm)
summary(ames_lm)

# ames_aov <- aov(Sale_Price ~ Exter_Qual, data = train) # Same thing with aov() function instead
# summary(ames_aov) # R-squared not reported here. 

```
The p-value for the ANOVA hypothesis that all the groups have the same mean sale price is incredibly small, at $2.2\times10^{-16}$. This means it is extraordinarily improbable that we would have observed these differences in means, or a more extreme difference, if the population group means were equal. Thus, we reject our null hypothesis and conclude that there is an association between the exterior quality of a home and the price of the home. 

We note, based on the $R^2$ statistics, that the exterior quality rating can account for almost half the variation in sales price! Adjusted $R^2$ is a statistic that takes into account the number of variables in the model. The difference between $R^2$ and adjusted $R^2$ will be more thoroughly discussed in Chapter \@ref(mlr).

We can also confirm what we know about the predictions from ANOVA, that there are only $k$ unique predictions from an ANOVA with $k$ groups (the predictions being the group means), using the `predict` function.

```{r}
train$pred_anova <- predict(ames_lm, data = train)

train$resid_anova <- resid(ames_lm, data = train)

(model_output = train %>% dplyr::select(Sale_Price, pred_anova, resid_anova))
```



### Testing Assumptions

We can use the default plots from the `lm()` function to check the normality assumption.

```{r label='anovaplots',fig.align='center',fig.cap='Of the 4 default plots from lm(), we are presently interested in the top-right QQ plot that tests our assumption of normally distributed residuals.'}

par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(ames_lm)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))

```
In the top-right plot in Figure \@ref(fig:anovaplots) we verify again the _approximate_ normality of sale price.  To test for the third assumption of equal variances, we opt for a formal test like Levene's (which depends on normality and can be found in the `car` package) or Fligner's (which does not depend on normality and exists in the `stats` package). In both cases, the null hypothesis is equal variances:
$$H_0: \sigma_a^2 =\sigma_b^2 =\sigma_c^2=\sigma_d^2 \quad  \text{i.e., the groups have equal variance}$$
$$H_a: \text{at least one group's variance is different}$$

```{r message=F}
library(car)
library(stats)

leveneTest(Sale_Price ~ Exter_Qual, data = train) # Most popular, but depends on Normality

fligner.test(Sale_Price ~ Exter_Qual, data = train) # DOES NOT depend on Normality

```
And in both cases, we're forced to reject the null hypothesis of equal variances. A non-parametric version of the ANOVA test, the Kruskal-Wallis test, is more suitable to this particular case. Non-parametric tests do not have the same _statistical power_ to detect differences between groups. __Statistical power__ is the probability of detecting an effect, if there is a true effect present to detect. We should opt for these tests in situations where our data is ordinal or otherwise violates the assumptions of normality or equal variances in ways that cannot be fixed by logarithmic or other similar transformation. 

### Kruskal-Wallis {#kruskal}

The Kruskal-Wallis test, proposed in 1952, is equivalent to a parametric one-way ANOVA where the data values have been replaced with their ranks (i.e. largest value = 1, second largest value = 2, etc.). When the data _is not_ normally distributed but _is_ identically distributed (having the same shape and variance), the Kruskal-Wallis test can be considered a test for differences in medians. If those identical distributions are also symmetric, then Kruskal-Wallis can be interpretted as testing for a difference in means. When the data is not identically distributed, or when the distributions are not symmetric, Kruskal-Wallis is a test of __dominance__ between distributions. __Distributional dominance__ is the notion that one group's distribution is located at larger values than another, probabilistically speaking.  Formally, a random variable A has dominance over random variable B if $P(A\geq x) \geq P(B\geq x)$ for all $x$, and for some $x$, $P(A\geq x) > P(B\geq x)$.

We summarize this information in the following table:

<table style="width:auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<tr> <td> Conditions <td> Interpretation of Significant <br> Kruskal-Wallis Test 
<tr> <td> Group distributions are identical in shape,<br> variance, and symmetric <td> Difference in means 
<tr> <td> Group distributions are identical in shape,<br> variance, but not symmetric <td> Difference in medians 
<tr> <td> Group distributions are not identical in shape,<br> variance, and are not symmetric <td> Difference in location. <br> (distributional dominance) </tr>
</table>

Implementing the Kruskal-Wallis test in R is simple:

```{r}
kruskal.test(Sale_Price ~ Exter_Qual, data = train)
```
Our conclusion would be that the distribution of sale price is different across different levels of exterior quality. 


## ANOVA Post-hoc Testing {#posthoc}

After performing an ANOVA and learning that there is a difference between the groups of data, our next natural question ought to be _which groups of data are different, and how?_ In order to explore this question, we must first consider the notion of __experimentwise error__. When conducting multiple hypothesis tests simultaneously, the experimentwise error rate is the proportion of time you expect to make an error in at least one test.

Let's suppose we are comparing grocery spending on 4 different credit card rewards programs. If we'd like to compare the rewards programs pairwise, that entails 6 different hypothesis tests (each is a two-sample t-test). If we keep a confidence level of $\alpha = 0.05$ and subsequently view "being wrong in one test" as a random event happening with probability $p=0.05$ then our probability of being wrong _in at least_ one test out of 6 could be as great as 0.26! 

To control this experiment-wise error rate, we must lower our significance thresholds to account for it. Alternatively, we can view this as an adjustment of our p-values higher while keeping our significance threshold fixed as usual. This is typically the approach taken, as we prefer to fix our significance thresholds in accordance with previous literature or industry standards. There are many methods of adjustment that have been proposed over the years for this purpose. Here, we consider two popular methods: Tukey's test for pairwise comparisons and Dunnett's test for control group comparisons. If the reader finds themselves in a situation that doesn't fit the prescription of either of these methods, we suggest looking next at the modified Bonferroni correction or the notion of false discovery rates proposed by Benjamini and Hochberg in 1995. 

### Tukey-Kramer {#tukey}

If our objective is to compare each group to every other group then Tukey's test of honest significant differences, also known as the Tukey-Kramer test is probably the most widely-available and popular corrections in practice. However, it should be noted that Tukey's test _should not_ be used if one does not plan to make all pairwise comparisons. If only a subset of comparisons are of interest to the user (like comparisons only to a control group) then one should opt for the Dunnett or a modified Bonferroni correction. 

To employ Tukey's HSD in R, we must use the `aov()` function to create our ANOVA object rather than the `lm()` function. The output of the test shows the difference in means and the p-value for testing the null hypothesis that the means are equal (i.e. that the differences are equal to 0). 

```{r label='tukey', fig.align='center', fig.cap = 'Confidence intervals for mean differences adjusted via Tukey-Kramer'}
ames_aov <- aov(Sale_Price ~ Exter_Qual, data = train)
tukey.ames <- TukeyHSD(ames_aov)
print(tukey.ames)

par(mar=c(4,10,4,2))
plot(tukey.ames, las = 1)
```
The p-values in this table have been adjusted higher to account for the possible experimentwise error rate. For every pairwise comparison shown, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the mean sales price of the homes is different for each level of `Exter_Qual`. Furthermore, Figure \@ref(fig:tukey) shows us experiment-wise (family-wise) adjusted confidence intervals for the differences in means for each pair.  The plot option `las=1` guides the axis labels. Type `?par` for a list of plot options for base R, including an explanation of `las`. 

### Dunnett's Test {#dunnett}

If the plan is to make fewer comparisons, specifically just $k-1$ comparisons where $k$ is the number of groups in your data (indicating you plan to compare all the groups to one specific group, usually the control group), then Dunnett's test would be preferrable to the Tukey-Kramer test. If all pairwise comparisons are not made, the Tukey-Kramer test is overly conservative, creating a confidence level that is much lower than specified by the user. Dunnett's test factors in fewer comparisons and thus should not be used for tests of all pairwise comparisons. 

To use Dunnett's test, we must add the `DescTools` package to our library. The control group to which all other groups will be compared is designated by the `control=` option. 

```{r message=F}
library(DescTools)
DunnettTest(x = train$Sale_Price, g = train$Exter_Qual, control = 'Typical')
```
In the output from Dunnett's test, we notice the p-value comparing `Fair` to `Typical` exterior qualities is lower than it was in the Tukey-Kramer test. This is consistent with our expectations for a test that isn't controlling for as many comparisons; it makes a smaller upward adjustment of p-values to satisfy a given experiment-wise error rate.


## Pearson Correlation {#cor}

  ANOVA is used to formally test the relationship between a categorical variable and a continuous variable. To formally test the (linear) relationship between two continuous attributes, we introduce __Pearson correlation__, commonly referred to as simply __correlation__. Correlation is a number between -1 and 1 which measures the strength of a linear relationship between two continuous attributes.

  Negative values of correlation indicate a _negative linear relationship_, meaning that as one of the variables increases, the other tends to decrease. Similarly, positive values of correlation indicate a _positive linear relationship_ meaning that as one of the variables increases, the other tends to increase. Absolute values of correlation equal to 1 indicate a perfect linear relationship.  For example, if our data had a column for "mile time in minutes" and a column for "mile time in seconds", these two columns would have a correlation of 1 due to the fact that there are 60 seconds in a minute. A correlation value near 0 indicates that the variables have no linear relationship.
  
  It's important to emphasize that Pearson correlation is only designed to detect _linear_ associations between variables. Even when a correlation between two variables is 0, the two variables may still have a very clear association, whether it be quadratic, cyclical, or some other nonlinear pattern of association. Figure \@ref(fig:correlation) illustrates all of these statements. On top of each scatter plot, the correlation coefficient is shown. The middle row of this figure aims to illustrate that a perfect correlation has nothing to do with the _magnitude_ or _slope_ of the relationship. In the center image, middle row, we note that the correlation is undefined for any pair that includes a constant variable. In that image, the value of $y$ is constant across the sample. Equation \@ref(eq:correlation) makes this mathematically clear.

```{r label='correlation', fig.align='center', fig.cap = 'Examples of relationships and their associated correlations', echo=F, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/correlation.png")
```

The population correlation parameter is denoted $\rho$ and estimated by the sample correlation, denoted as $r$. The formula for the sample correlation between columns of data $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ is

\begin{equation}
r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{x})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar{x})^2\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\bar{x})^2}}.
(\#eq:correlation)
\end{equation}

Note that with _centered_ variable vectors $\mathbf{x_c}$ and $\mathbf{y_c}$ this formula becomes much cleaner with linear algebra notation:

\begin{equation}
r = \frac{\mathbf{x_c}^T\mathbf{y_c}}{\|\mathbf{x_c}\|\|\mathbf{y_c}\|}.
(\#eq:veccorrelation)
\end{equation}

It is interesting to note that Equation \@ref(eq:veccorrelation) is identical to the formula for the cosine of the angle between to vectors. While this geometrical relationship does not benefit our intuition^[The n-dimensional "variable vectors" \mathbf{x_c} and \mathbf{y_c} live in the vast _sample space_ where the $i^{th}$ axis represents the $i^th$ observation in your dataset. In this space, a single point/vector is one possible set of sample values of n observations; this space can be difficult to grasp mentally], it is noteworthy nonetheless. 
 
Pearson's correlation can be calculated in R with the built in `cor()` function, with the two continuous variables as input:

```{r}
cor(train$Gr_Liv_Area,train$Sale_Price)
```

### Statistical Test {#testcor}

To test the statistical significance of correlation, we use a t-test with the null hypothesis that the correlation is equal to 0:
$$H_0: \rho = 0$$
$$H_a: \rho \neq 0$$
If we can reject the null hypothesis, then we declare a significant linear association between the two variables. The `cor.test()` function in R will perform the test:

```{r}
cor.test(train$Gr_Liv_Area,train$Sale_Price)
```

We conclude that `Gr_Liv_Area` has a linear association with Sale_Price. 

It must be noted that this t-test for Pearson's correlation is not free from assumptions. In fact, there are 4 assumptions that must be met, and they are detailed in Section \@ref(slrassumptions). 

### Effect of Anomalous Observations

One final nuance that is important to note is the effect of anomalous observations on correlation. In Figure \@ref(fig:nocor) we display 30 random 2-dimensional data points $(x,y)$ with no linear relationship. 

```{r  fig=T, fig.align='center', fig.cap = 'The variables x and y have no correlation', label='nocor'}
set.seed(11)
x <- rnorm(30)
y <- rnorm(30)
plot(x,y)
```

The correlation is not exactly zero (we wouldn't expect perfection from random data) but it is very close at 0.002.
```{r}
cor.test(x,y)
```
Next, we'll add a single anomalous observation to our data and see how it affects both the correlation value and the correlation test.

```{r}
x[31] = 4
y[31] = 50
cor.test(x,y)
```
The correlation jumps to 0.73 from 0.002 and is declared strongly significant! Figure \@ref(fig:extremenocor) illustrates the new data. This simple example shows why exploratory data analysis is so important! If we don't explore our data and detect anomalous observations, we might improperly declare relationships are significant when they are driven by a single observation or a small handful of observations.

```{r fig=T, fig.align='center', fig.cap = 'A single anomalous observation creates strong correlation (0.73) where there previously was none', label='extremenocor'}
plot(x,y)
```

### The Correlation Matrix

It's common to consider and calculate all pairwise correlations between variables in a dataset. If many attributes share a high degree of mutual correlation, this can cause problems for regression as will be discussed in Chapter 5. The pairwise correlations are generally arranged in an array called the __correlation matrix__, where the $(i,j)^{th}$ entry is the correlation between the $i^{th}$ variable and $j^{th}$ variable in your list. To compute the correlation matrix, we again use the `cor()` function.

```{r}
cor(train[, c('Year_Built','Total_Bsmt_SF','First_Flr_SF','Gr_Liv_Area','Sale_Price')])
```

Not surprisingly, we see strong positive correlation between the square footage of the basement and that of the first floor, and also between all of the area variables and the sale price. As demonstrated by Figures \@ref(fig:correlation) and \@ref(fig:extremenocor), raw correlation values can be misleading and it's unwise to calculate them without a scatter plot for context. The `pairs()` function in base R provides a simple matrix of scatterplots for this purpose.

```{r}
pairs(train[, c('Year_Built','Total_Bsmt_SF','First_Flr_SF','Gr_Liv_Area','Sale_Price')])
```


## Simple Linear Regression 

After learning that two variables share a linear relationship, the next question is natural: _what is that relationship?_ How much,on average, should we expect one variable to change as the other changes by a single unit? Simple linear regression answers this question by creating a linear equation that best represents the relationship in the sense that it minimizes the squared error between the observed data and the model predictions (i.e. the sum of the squared residuals). The simple linear regression equation is typically written
\begin{equation}
y=\beta_0 + \beta_1x + \varepsilon
(\#eq:slr)
\end{equation}
where $\beta_0$, the __intercept__, gives the expected value of $y$ when $x=0$ and $\beta_1$, the __slope__ gives the expected change in $y$ for a one-unit increase in $x$. The __error__, $\varepsilon$ is the amount each individual $y$ differs from the population line (we would not expect all values of $y$ to fall directly on the line).  When we use a sample of data to estimate the true population line, we get our prediction equation or $\hat{y}=\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1x$. Residuals from the predicted line is defined as $e=y-\hat{y}$. _Ordinary Least Squares seeks to minimize the sum of squared residuals or sum of squared error_. That objective is known as a __loss function__. The sum of squared error (SSE) or equivalently the mean squared error (MSE) loss functions are by far the most popular loss functions for continuous prediction problems. 

We should note that SSE is not the _only_ loss function at our disposal. Minimizing the _mean absolute error_ (MAE) is common in situations with a highly skewed response variable (squaring very large errors gives those observations in the tail too much influence on the regression as we will later discuss). Using MAE to drive our loss function gives us predictions that are conditional _medians_ of the response, given the input data. Other loss functions, like Huber's M function, are also used to handle problems with influential observations as discussed in Chapter 5.

As we mentioned in Section \@ref(evp), a simple linear regression serves two purposes:
<ol>
<li> to predict the expected value of $y$ for each value of $x$ and 
<li> to explain _how_ $y$ is expected to change for a unit change in $x$. 
</ol>
In order to accurately use a regression for the second purpose, however, we must first meet assumptions with our data. 

### Assumptions of Linear Regression {#slrassumptions}

Linear regression, in particular the hypothesis tests that are generally performed as part of linear regression, has 4 assumptions:

<ol> 
<li> The expected value of $y$ is linear in $x$ (proper model specification).
<li> The random errors are independent.
<li> The random errors are normally distributed.
<li> The random errors have equal variance (homoskedasticity).
</ol>

It must now be noted that these assumptions are also in effect for the test of Pearson's correlation in Section \@ref(testcor), because the tests in simple linear regression are mathematically equivalent to that test. When these assumptions are not met, another approach to testing the significance of a linear relationship should be considered. The most common non-parametric approach to testing for an association between two continuous variables is Spearman's correlation. Spearman's correlation does not limit its findings to linear relationships; any monotonic relationship (one that is always increasing or always decreasing) will cause Spearman's correlation to be significant. Similar to the approach taken by Kruskal-Wallis, Spearman's correlation replaces the data with its ranks and computes Pearson's correlation on the ranks. The same `cor` and `cor.test()` functions can be used; simply specify the `method='spearman'` option. 

```{r}
cor.test(train$Gr_Liv_Area,train$Sale_Price, method = 'spearman')
```

### Testing for Association

The statistical test of correlation is mathematically equivalent to testing the hypothesis that the slope parameter in Equation \@ref(eq:slr) is zero. This t-test is part of the output from any linear regression function, like `lm()` which we saw in Section \@ref(oneway). Let's confirm this using the example from the Section \@ref(testcor) where we investigate the relationship between `Gr_Liv_Area` and `Sale_Price`. Again, the t-test in the output tests the following hypothesis:
$$H_0: \beta_1=0$$
$$H_a: \beta_1 \neq 0$$
The first thing we will do after creating the linear model is check our assumption using the default plots from `lm()` . From these four plots we will be most interested in the first two.

In the top left plot, we are visually checking for homoskedasticity. We'd like to see the variability of the points remain constant from left to right on this chart, indicating that the errors have constant variance for each value of y. We do not want to see any fan shapes in this chart. Unfortunately, we do see just that: the variability of the errors is much smaller for smaller values of Sale Price than it is for larger values of Sale Price. 

In the top right plot, we are visually checking for normality of errors. We'd like to see the QQ-plot indicate normality with all the points roughly following the line. Unfortunately, we do not see that here. The errors do not appear to be normally distributed. 

```{r fig=T, fig.align='center', fig.cap = 'The variables x and y have no correlation', label='slrplots'}
slr <- lm(Sale_Price ~ Gr_Liv_Area, data=train)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(slr)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```
Despite the violation of assumptions, let's continue examining the output from this regression in order to practice our interpretation of it. 
```{r}
summary(slr)
```
The first thing we're likely to examine in the coefficient table is the p-value for `Gr_Liv_Area`. It is strongly significant (in fact, it's the same t-value and p-value as we saw for the `cor.test` as these tests are mathematically equivalent), indicating that there is an association between the size of the home and the sale price. Furthermore, the _parameter estimate_ is 115.5 indicating that we'd expect the price of a home to increase by \$115.5 for every additional square foot of living space. Because of the linearity of the model, we can extend this slope estimate to any unit change in $x$. For example, it might be difficult to think in terms of single square feet when comparing houses, so we might prefer to use a 100 square-foot change and report our conclusion as follows: For each additional 100 square feet of living area, we expect the house price to increase by \$11,550.

# Complex ANOVA and Multiple Linear Regression {#mlr}
In in Chapter \@ref(slr) we were introduced to the One-Way ANOVA and simple linear regression models. These models only contained a single variable - categorical for ANOVA and continuous for simple linear regression - to explain and predict our target variable. Rarely do we believe that only a single variable will suffice in predicting a variable of interest. Here in this Chapter we will generalize these models to the $n$-Way ANOVA and multiple linear regression models. These models contain multiple sets of variables to explain and predict our target variable.

This Chapter aims to answer the following questions:
<ul>
  <li> How do we include multiple variables in ANOVA? 
    <ul> 
      <li> Exploration
      <li> Assumptions
      <li> Predictions
    </ul>
  <li> What is an interaction between two predictor variables?
    <ul>
      <li> Interpretation
      <li> Evaluation
      <li> Within Category Effects
    </ul>
  <li> What is blocking in ANOVA?
    <ul>
      <li> Nuisance Factors
      <li> Differences Between Blocking and Two-Way ANOVA
    </ul>
  <li> How do we include multiple variables in regression?

    </ul>
</ul>

## Two-Way ANOVA
Section \@ref(slr) details the One-Way ANOVA model using a single categorical predictor variable with $k$ levels to predict our continuous target variable. Now we will generalize this model to include $n$ categorical variables that each have different numbers of levels ($k_1, k_2, ..., k_n$).

### Exploration
Let's use the basic example of two categorical predictor variables in a Two-Way ANOVA. Previously, we talked about using heating quality as a factor to explain and predict sale price of homes in Ames, Iowa. Now, we also consider whether the home has central air. Although similar in nature, these two factors potentially provide important, unique pieces of information about the home. Similar to previous data science problems, let us first explore our variables and their potential relationships.

Now that we have two variables that we will use to explain and predict sale price, here are some summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) for each combination of category. We will use the ```group_by``` function on both predictor variables of interest to split the data and then the ```summarise``` function to calculate the metrics we are interested in.

```{r}
train %>% 
  group_by(Heating_QC, Central_Air) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(mean = mean(Sale_Price), 
            sd = sd(Sale_Price), 
            max = max(Sale_Price), 
            min = min(Sale_Price))

```

We can already see above that there appears to be some differences in average sale price across the categories overall. Within each grouping of heating quality, homes with central air appear to have a higher sale price than homes without. Also, similar to before, homes with higher heating quality appear to have higher sale prices compared to homes with lower heating quality. 

We also see these relationships in the bar chart in Figure \@ref(fig:twomeans).

```{r fig=T, fig.align='center', fig.cap = 'Distribution of Variables Heating_QC and Central_Air', label='twomeans'}
CA_heat <- train %>% 
  group_by(Heating_QC, Central_Air) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(mean = mean(Sale_Price), 
            sd = sd(Sale_Price), 
            max = max(Sale_Price), 
            min = min(Sale_Price))

ggplot(data = CA_heat, aes(x = Heating_QC, y = mean/1000, fill = Central_Air)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge()) +
  labs(y = "Sales Price (Thousands $)", x = "Heating Quality Category") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired") +
  theme_minimal()
```
As before, visually looking at bar charts and mean calculations only goes so far. We need to statistically be sure of any differences that exist between average sale price in categories.

### Model
We are going to do this with the same approach as in the One-Way ANOVA of Chapter \@ref(slr), just with more variables as shown in the following equation:

$$
Y_{ijk} = \mu + \alpha_i + \beta_j + \varepsilon_{ijk}
$$
where $\mu$ is the average baseline sales price of a home in Ames, Iowa, $\alpha_i$ is the variable representing the impacts of the levels of heating quality, and $\beta_j$ is the variable representing the impacts of the levels of central air. As mentioned previously, the unexplained error in this model is represented as $\varepsilon_{ijk}$.

The same F test approach is also used, just for each one of the variables. Each variable's test has a null hypothesis assuming all categories have the same mean. The alternative for each test is that at least one category's mean is different.

Let's view the results of the ```aov``` function.

```{r}
ames_aov2 <- aov(Sale_Price ~ Heating_QC + Central_Air, data = train)

summary(ames_aov2)
```
From the above results, we have low p-values for each of the variables' F test. Heating quality had 4 degrees of freedom, derived from the 5 categories $(4 = 5-1)$. Similarly, central air's 2 categories produce 1 $(= 2-1)$ degree of freedom. The F values are calculated the exact same way as described before with the mean square for each variable divided by the mean square error. Based on these tests, at least one category in each variable is statistically different than the rest.

### Post-Hoc Testing
As with the One-Way ANOVA, the next logical question is which of these categories is different. We will use the same post-hoc tests as before with the ```TukeyHSD``` function.

```{r}
tukey.ames2 <- TukeyHSD(ames_aov2)
print(tukey.ames2)

plot(tukey.ames2, las = 1)
```

Starting with the variable for central air, we can see there is a statistical difference between the two categories. This is the exact same result as the overall F test for the variable since there are only two categories. For the heating quality variable, we can see some categories are different from each other, while others are not. Noticeably, the combination of poor with fair, good, and typical categories are **not** statistically different. Notice also the different widths of these confidence intervals do to the different combinations of sample sizes for the categories being tested.

## Two-Way ANOVA with Interactions
What if the relationship between a predictor and target variable changed depending on the value of another predictor variable? For our example, we would say that the average difference in sales price between having central air and not having central changed depending on what level of heating quality the home had. In the bar chart in Figure \@ref(fig:twomeans), a potential interaction effect is displayed when the differences between the two bars within each heating category is different across heating category. If the difference, was the same, then there is no interaction present. In other words, no matter the heating quality rating of the home, the average difference in sales price between having central air and not having central air is the same.

This interaction model is represented as follows:

$$
Y_{ijk} = \mu + \alpha_i + \beta_j + (\alpha \beta)_{ij} + \varepsilon_{ijk}
$$

with the interaction effect, $(\alpha \beta)_{ij}$, as the multiplication of the two variables involved in the interaction. Interactions can occur between more than two variables as well. Interactions are good to evaluate as they can mask the effects of individual variables. For example, imagine a hypothetical example as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:twomeansint) where the impact of having central air is opposite depending on which category of heating quality you have.

```{r}
fake_HQ <- c("Poor", "Poor", "Excellent", "Excellent")
fake_CA <- c("N", "Y", "N", "Y")
fake_mean <- c(100, 150, 150, 100)

fake_df <- as.data.frame(cbind(fake_HQ, fake_CA, fake_mean))
```

```{r fig=T, fig.align='center', fig.cap = 'Distribution of Variables Heating_QC and Central_Air', label='twomeansint'}
ggplot(data = fake_df, aes(x = fake_HQ, y = as.numeric(fake_mean), fill = fake_CA)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge()) +
  labs(y = "Fake Sales Price (Thousands $)", x = "Fake Heating Quality Category") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired") +
  theme_minimal()
```

If you were to only look at the average sales price across heating quality, you would notice no difference between the two groups (average for both heating categories is 125). However, when the interaction is accounted for, you can clearly see in the bar heights that sales price is different depending on the value of central air.

Let's evaluate the interaction term in our actual data. To do so, we just incorporate the multiplication of the two variables in the model statement by using the formula ```Sale_Price ~ Heating_QC + Central_Air + Heating_QC:Central_Air```. You could also use the shorthand version of this by using the formula ```Sale_Price ~ Heating_QC*Central_Air```. The ```*``` will include both main effects (the individual variables) and the interaction between them.

```{r}
ames_aov_int <- aov(Sale_Price ~ Heating_QC*Central_Air, data = train)

summary(ames_aov_int)
```
As seen by the output above, the interaction effect between heating quality and central air is **not** significant at the 0.05 level. Again, this implies that the average difference in sale price of the home between having central air and not does not differ depending on which category of heating quality the home belongs to. If our interaction was significant (say a 0.02 p-value instead) then we would keep it in our model, but here we would remove the interaction term from our model and rerun the analysis.

### Post-Hoc Testing
Post-hoc tests are also available for interaction models as well to determine where the statistical differences exist in all the combinations of possible categories. We evaluate these post-hoc tests using the same ```TukeyHSD``` function and its corresponding ```plot``` element.

```{r}
tukey.ames_int <- TukeyHSD(ames_aov_int)
print(tukey.ames_int)

plot(tukey.ames_int, las = 1)
```

In the giant table above as well as the confidence interval plots, you are able to inspect which combination of categories are statistically different.

With interactions present in ANOVA models, post-hoc tests might get overwhelming in trying to find where differences exist. To help guide the exploration of post-hoc tests with interactions, we can do **slicing**. Slicing is when you perform One-Way ANOVA on subsets of data within categories of other variables. Even though the interaction in our model was not significant, let's imagine that it was for the sake of example. For example, to help discover differences in the interaction between central air and heating quality, we could subset the data into two groups - homes with central air and homes without. Within these two groups we perform One-Way ANOVA across heating quality to find where differences might exist within subgroups.

This can easily be done with the ```group_by``` function to subset the data. The ```nest``` and ```mutate``` functions are also used to applied the ```aov``` function to each subgroup. Here we run a One-Way ANOVA for heating quality within each subset of central air being present or not.

```{r}
CA_aov <- train %>% 
  group_by(Central_Air) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(aov = map(data, ~summary(aov(Sale_Price ~ Heating_QC, data = .x))))

CA_aov
print(CA_aov$aov)
```
We can see that both of these results are significant at the 0.05 level. This implies that there are statistical differences in average sale price across heating quality within homes that have central air as well as those that don't have central air. 

### Assumptions
The assumptions for the $n$-Way ANOVA are the same as with the One-Way ANOVA - independence of observations, normality for each category of variable, and equal variances. With the inclusion of two or more variables ($n$-Way ANOVA with $n > 1$), these assumptions can be harder to evaluate and test. These assumptions are then applied to the residuals of the model. 

For equal variances, we can still apply the Levene Test for equal variances using the same ```leveneTest``` function as in Chapter \@ref(slr).

```{r}
leveneTest(Sale_Price ~ Heating_QC*Central_Air, data = train)
```
From this test, we can see that we **do not** meet our assumption of equal variance. 

Let's explore the normality assumption. Again, we will assume this normality on the random error component, $\varepsilon_{ijk}$, of the ANOVA model. More details are found for diagnostic testing using the error component in Chapter \@ref(diag). We can check normality using the same approaches of the QQ-plot or statistical testing as in Chapter \@ref(eda). Here we will use the ```plot``` function on the ```aov``` object. Specifically, we want the second plot which is why we have a ```2``` in the ```plot``` function option. We then use the ```shapiro.test``` function on the error component. The estimate of the error component is calculated using the ```residuals``` function.

```{r}
plot(ames_aov_int, 2)

ames_res <- residuals(ames_aov_int)

shapiro.test(x = ames_res)
```
Neither of the normality or equal variance assumptions appear to be met here. This would be a good scenario to have a non-parametric approach. Unfortunately, the Kruskal-Wallis approach is not applicable to $n$-Way ANOVA where $n > 1$. These approaches would need more non-parametric versions of multiple regression models to account for them.

## Randomized Block Design
There are two typical groups of data analysis studies that are conducted. The first are observational/retrospective studies which are the typical data problems people try to solve. The primary characteristic of these analysis are looking at what already happened (retrospective) and potentially inferring those results to further data. These studies have little control over other factors contributing to the target of interest because data is collected after the fact.

The other type of data analysis study are controlled experiments. In these situations, you often want to look at the outcome measure prospectively. The focus of the controlled experiment is to control for other factors that might contribute to the target variable. By manipulating these factors of interest, one can more reasonably claim causation. We can more reasonably claim causation when random assignment is used to eliminate potential **nuisance factors**. Nuisance factors are variables that can potentially impact the target variable, but are not of interest in the analysis directly. 

### Garlic Bulb Weight Example
For this analysis we will use a new dataset. This dataset contains the average garlic bulb weight from different plots of land. We want to compare the effects of fertilizer on average bulb weight. However, different plots of land could have different levels of sun exposure, pH for the soil, and rain amounts. Since we cannot alter the pH of the soil easily, or control the sun and rain, we can use blocking to account for these nuisance factors. Each fertilizer was randomly applied in quadrants of 8 plots of land. These 8 plots have different values for sun exposure, pH, and rain amount. Therefore, if we only put one fertilizer on each plot, we would not know if the fertilizer was the reason the garlic crop grew or if it was one of the nuisance factors. Since we **blocked** these 8 plots and applied all four fertilizers in each we have essentially accounted for (or removed the effect of) the nuisance factors. 

Let's briefly explore this new dataset by looking at all 32 values using the ```print``` function.

```{r}
block <- read_csv(file = "garlic_block.csv")

head(block, n = 32)
```

How do we account for this blocking in an ANOVA model context? This blocking ANOVA model is the exact same as the Two-Way ANOVA model. The variable that identifies which sector (block) an observation is in serves as another variable in the model. Think about this variable as the variable that accounts for all the nuisance factors in your ANOVA. That means we have two variables in this ANOVA model - fertilizer and sector (the block that accounts for sun exposure, pH level of soil, rain amount, etc.).

For this we can use the same ```aov``` function we described above.

```{r}
block_aov <- aov(BulbWt ~ factor(Fertilizer) + factor(Sector), data = block)

summary(block_aov)
```

Using the ```summary``` function we can see that both the sector (block) and fertilizer variables are significant in the model at the 0.05 level. What are the interpretations of this? 
First, let's address the blocking variable. Whether it is significant or not, it should **always** be included in the model. This is due to the fact that the data is structured in that way. It is a construct of the data that should be accounted for regardless of the significance. However, since the blocking variable (sector) was significant, that implies that different plots of land have different impacts of the average bulb weight of garlic. Again, this is most likely due to the differences between the plots of land - namely sun exposure, pH of soil, rain fall, etc.

Second, the variable of interest is the fertilizer variable. It is significant, implying that there is a difference in the average bulb weight of garlic for different fertilizers. To examine which fertilizer pairs are statistically difference we can use post-hos testing as described in the previous parts of this chapter using the ```TukeyHSD``` function.

```{r}
tukey.block <- TukeyHSD(block_aov)
print(tukey.block)

plot(tukey.block, las = 1)
```

### Assumptions
Outside of the typical assumptions for ANOVA that still hold here, there are two additional assumptions to be met:
- Treatments are randomly assigned within each block
- The effects of the treatment variable are constant across the levels of the blocking variable

The first, new assumption of randomness deals with the reliability of the analysis. Randomness is key to removing the impact of the nuisance factors. The second, new assumption implies there is **no interaction** between the treatment variable and the blocking variable. For example, we are implying that the fertilizers' impacts ob garlic bulb weight are not changed depending on what block you are on. In other words, fertilizers have the same impact regardless of sun exposure, pH levels, rain fall, etc. We are **not** saying these nuisance factors do not impact the target variable or bulb weight of garlic, just that they do not change the effect of the fertilizer on bulb weight.

## Multiple Linear Regression
Most practical applications of of regression modeling involve using more complicated models than a simple linear regression with only one predictor variable to predict your target. Additional variables in a model can lead to better explanations and predictions of the target. These linear regressions with more than one variable are called **multiple linear regression** models. However, as we will see in this section and the following chapters, with more variables comes much more complication.

### Model Structure
Multiple linear regression models have the same structure as simple linear regression models, only with more variables. The multiple linear regression model with $k$ variables is structured like the following:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \cdots + \beta_k x_k + \varepsilon
$$

This model has the predictor variables $x_1, x_2, ..., x_k$ trying to either explain or predict the target variable $y$. The intercept, $\beta_0$, still gives the expected value of $y$, when **all** of the predictor variables take a value of 0. With the addition of multiple predictors, the interpretation of the slope coefficients change slightly. The slopes, $\beta_1, \beta_2, ..., \beta_k$, give the expected change in $y$ for a one unit change in the respective predictor variable, **holding all other predictor variables constant**. The random error term, $\varepsilon$, is the error between our predicted value, $\hat{y} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x_1 + \cdots + \hat{\beta}_k x_k$, and our actual value of $y$. 

Unlike simple linear regression that can be visualized as a line through a 2-dimensional scatterplot of data, a multiple linear regression is better thought of as a multi-dimensional plane through a multi-dimensional scatterplot of data. 

Let's visual an example with two predictor variables - the square footage of greater living area and the total number of rooms. These will predict sale price of a home. When none of the variables have any relationship with the target variable, we get a horizontal plane like the one shown below. This is similar in concept to a horizontal line in simple linear regression having a slope of 0, implying that the target variable does not change as the predictor variable changes.

```{r echo=FALSE}
lm0 <- lm(Sale_Price ~ 1, data = train)

train0 <- train %>% 
  mutate(lm0_pred = predict(lm0))

area <- unique(train$Gr_Liv_Area)
rooms <- unique(train$TotRms_AbvGrd)

area <- seq(min(train$Gr_Liv_Area), max(train$Gr_Liv_Area), length.out = 25)
rooms <- seq(min(train$TotRms_AbvGrd), max(train$TotRms_AbvGrd), length.out = 25)

pred_grid <- expand.grid(area, rooms) %>% 
  add_predictions(lm0)

pred_mx <- matrix(pred_grid$pred,
                  ncol = 25,
                  nrow = 25)

plot_ly() %>% add_surface(x = ~ 300:6000, 
                          y = ~ 1:15, 
                          z = ~ pred_mx
) %>% layout(scene = list(xaxis = list(title = "Living Area (SQFT)"), yaxis = list(title = "Total Rooms"), zaxis = list(title = "Sale Price")))

```

Much like if the slope of a simple linear regression line is **not** 0 (a relationship exists between the predictor and target variable), then a relationship between any of the predictor variables and the target variable shifts and rotates the plane around like the one shown below. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
lm1 <- lm(Sale_Price ~ Gr_Liv_Area + TotRms_AbvGrd, data = train)

train0 <- train %>% 
  mutate(lm1_pred = predict(lm1))

area <- unique(train0$Gr_Liv_Area)
rooms <- unique(train0$TotRms_AbvGrd)

area <- seq(min(train0$Gr_Liv_Area), max(train0$Gr_Liv_Area), length.out = 25)
rooms <- seq(min(train0$TotRms_AbvGrd), max(train0$TotRms_AbvGrd), length.out = 25)

pred_grid <- expand.grid(area, rooms) %>%
  rename(Gr_Liv_Area = Var1,
         TotRms_AbvGrd = Var2) %>%
  add_predictions(lm1)

pred_mx <- matrix(pred_grid$pred,
                  ncol = 25,
                  nrow = 25)

plot_ly() %>% add_surface(x = ~ 300:6000, 
                          y = ~ 1:15, 
                          z = ~ pred_mx
) %>% layout(scene = list(xaxis = list(title = "Living Area (SQFT)"), yaxis = list(title = "Total Rooms"), zaxis = list(title = "Sale Price")))

```

To the naive viewer, the shifted plane would still make sense because of the model naming convention of multiple **linear** regression. However, the **linear** in linear regression doesn't have to deal with the visualization of the fitted plane (or line in two dimensions), but instead refers to the **linear combination of variables**. A linear combination is an expression constructed from a set of terms by multiplying each term by a constant and adding the results. For example, $ax + by$ is a linear combination of $x$ and $y$. Therefore, the linear model

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \cdots + \beta_k x_k + \varepsilon
$$
is a linear combination of predictor variables in their relationship with the target variable $y$. These predictor variables do not all have to contain linear effects though. For example, let's look at a linear regression model with four predictor variables:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_3 + \beta_4 x_4 + \varepsilon
$$

One would not be hard pressed to call this model a linear regression. However, what if we defined $x_3 = x_1^2$ and $x_4 = x_2^2$? 

```{r echo=FALSE}
lm2 <- lm(Sale_Price ~ Gr_Liv_Area + TotRms_AbvGrd + I(Gr_Liv_Area^2) + I(TotRms_AbvGrd^2), data = train)

train0 <- train %>% 
  mutate(lm2_pred = predict(lm2))

area <- unique(train0$Gr_Liv_Area)
rooms <- unique(train0$TotRms_AbvGrd)

area <- seq(min(train0$Gr_Liv_Area), max(train0$Gr_Liv_Area), length.out = 25)
rooms <- seq(min(train0$TotRms_AbvGrd), max(train0$TotRms_AbvGrd), length.out = 25)

pred_grid <- expand.grid(area, rooms) %>%
  rename(Gr_Liv_Area = Var1,
         TotRms_AbvGrd = Var2) %>%
  add_predictions(lm2)

pred_mx <- matrix(pred_grid$pred,
                  ncol = 25,
                  nrow = 25)

plot_ly() %>% add_surface(x = ~ 300:6000, 
                          y = ~ 1:15, 
                          z = ~ pred_mx
) %>% layout(scene = list(xaxis = list(title = "Living Area (SQFT)"), yaxis = list(title = "Total Rooms"), zaxis = list(title = "Sale Price")))

```

This model is still a linear regression model. The structure of the model did not change. The model is still a linear combination of predictor variables related to the target variable. The predictor variables just do not all have a linear effect in terms of their relationship with $y$. However, mathematically, it is still a linear combination and a linear regression model. Logistic regression on the other hand, which will be covered in Chapter \@ref(cat) is an example of a **nonlinear** regression model.

### Global & Local Inference
In simple linear regression we could just look at the t-test for our slope parameter estimate to determine the utility of our model. With multiple parameter estimates comes multiple t-tests. Instead of looking at every individual parameter estimate initially, there is a way to determine the model adequacy for predicting the target variable overall.

The utility of a multiple regression model can be tested with a single test that encompasses all the coefficients from the model. This kind of test is called a **global test** since it tests all $\beta$'s simultaneously. The **Global F-Test** uses the F-distribution to do just that for multiple linear regression models. The hypotheses for this test are the following:

$$
H_0: \beta_1 = \beta_2 = \cdots = \beta_k = 0 \\
H_A: \text{at least one } \beta \text{ is nonzero}
$$

In simpler terms, the null hypothesis is that none of the variables are useful in predicting the target variable. The alternative hypothesis is that **at least one** of these variables is useful in predicting the target variable.

The F-distribution is a distribution that has the following characteristics:
- Bounded below by 0
- Right-skewed
- Both **numerator** and **denominator** degrees of freedom

A plot of a variety of F distributions is shown here:

```{r echo=FALSE}
data.frame(f = 0:1000 / 100) %>% 
           mutate(df_1_1 = df(x = f, df1 = 1, df2 = 1),
                  df_10_20 = df(x = f, df1 = 10, df2 = 30),
                  df_5_4 = df(x = f, df1 = 5, df2 = 4)) %>%
  gather(key = "df", value = "density", -f) %>%
ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = f, y = density, color = df, linetype = df)) +
  labs(title = "F at Various Degrees of Freedom",
       x = "F",
       y = "Density") +
  xlim(0,5) + ylim(0,1) +theme_minimal()
```


If the global test is significant, the next step would be to examine the individual t-tests to see which variables are significant and which ones are not. This is similar to post-hoc testing in ANOVA where we explored which of the categories was statistically different when we knew at least one was.

These tests are all available using the ```summary``` function on an ```lm``` function for linear regression. To build a multiple linear regression in R using the ```lm``` function, you just add another variable to the formula element. Here we will predict the sales price (```Sale_Price```) based on the square footage of the greater living area of the home (```Gr_Liv_Area```) as well as total number of rooms above ground (```TotRms_AbvGrd```). 

```{r}
ames_lm2 <- lm(Sale_Price ~ Gr_Liv_Area + TotRms_AbvGrd, data = train)

summary(ames_lm2)
```

At the bottom of the above output is the result of the global F-test. Since the p-value on this test is lower than the significance level of 0.05, we have statistical evidence that at least of the two variables - ```Gr_Liv_Area``` and ```TotRms_AbvGrd``` - is significant at predicting the sale price of the home. By looking at the individual t-tests in the output above, we can see that both variables are actually significant.

### Assumptions
The **main** assumptions for the multiple linear regression model are the same as with the simple linear regression model:

1. The expected value of $y$ is linear in the $x$'s (proper model specification).
2. The random errors are independent.
3. The random errors are normally distributed.
4. The random errors have equal variance (homoskedasticity).

However, with multiple variables there is an additional assumption that people tend to add to multiple linear regression modeling:
5. No **perfect** collinearity (also called multicollinearity)

The new assumption means that no combination of predictor variables is a perfect linear combination with any other predictor variables. Collinearity, also called multicollinearity, occurs when predictor variables are correlated with each other. People often misstate this additional assumption as having no collinearity at all. This is too restrictive and basically impossible to meet in a realistic setting. Only when collinearity has a drastic impact on the linear regression do we need to concern ourselves. In fact, linear regression only completely breaks when that collinearity is perfect. Dealing with multicollinearity is the subject of Chapter \@ref(diag).

Similar to simple linear regression, we can evaluate the assumptions by looking at residual plots. The ```plot``` function on the ```lm``` object provides these.

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(ames_lm2)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```

These will again be covered in much more detail in Chapter \@ref(diag).

### Multiple Coefficients of Determination
One of the main advantages of multiple linear regression is that the complexity of the model enables us to investigate the relationship among $y$ and several predictor variables simultaneously. However, this increased complexity makes it more difficult to not only interpret the models, but also ascertain which model is "best."

One example of this would be the coefficient of determination, $R^2$, that we discussed in Chapter \@ref(slr). The calculation for $R^2$ is the exact same:

$$
R^2 = 1 - \frac{SSE}{TSS}
$$

However, the problem with the calculation of $R^2$ in a multiple linear regression is that the addition of any variable (useful or not) will never make the $R^2$ decrease. In fact, it typically increases even with the addition of a useless variable. The reason is rather intuitive. When adding information to a regression model, your predictions can only get better, not worse. If a new predictor variable has no impact on the target variable, then the predictions can not get any worse than what they already were before the addition of the useless variable. Therefore, the $SSE$ would never increase, making the $R^2$ never decrease.

To account for this problem, there is the **adjusted coefficient of determination**, $R^2_a$. The calculation is the following:

$$
R^2_a = 1 - [(\frac{n-1}{n-(k+1)})\times (\frac{SSE}{TSS})]
$$

Notice what the calculation is doing. It takes the original ratio on the right hand side of the $R^2$ equation, $SSE/TSS$, and penalizes it. It multiplies this number by a ratio that is always greater than 1 if $k > 0$. Remember, $k$ is the number of variables in the model. Therefore, as the number of variables increases, the calculation penalizes the model more and more. However, if the reduction of SSE from adding a useful variable is low enough, then even with the additional penalization, the $R^2_a$ will increase **if the variable is a useful addition to the model**. If the variable is not a useful addition to the model, the $R^2_a$ will decrease. The $R^2_a$ is only one of many ways to select the "best" model for multiple linear regression. Many more metrics will be discussed in model selection in Chapter \@ref(sel).

One downside of this new metric is that the $R^2_a$ loses its interpretation. Since $R^2_a \le R^2$, it is no longer bounded below by zero. Therefore, it can no longer be the proportion of variation explained in the target variable by the model. However, we can easily use $R^2_a$ to select a model correctly and interpret that model with $R^2$. Both of these numbers can be found using the ```summary``` function on the ```lm``` object from the previous model.

```{r}
summary(ames_lm2)
```

From this output we can say that the combination of ```Gr_Liv_Area``` and ```TotRmsAbvGrd``` account for 50.24% of the variation in ```Sale_Price```. Now let's add a random variable to the model. This random variable will take random values from a normal distribution with mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 and has no impact on the target variable.

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
ames_lm3 <- lm(Sale_Price ~ Gr_Liv_Area + TotRms_AbvGrd + rnorm(length(Sale_Price), 0, 1), data = train)

summary(ames_lm3)
```

Notice that the $R^2$ of this model actually increased to 0.5028 from 0.5024. However, the $R^2_a$ value stayed approximately the same at 0.502 since the addition of this new variable did not provide enough predictive power to outweigh the penalty of adding it.

### Categorical Predictor Variables
As mentioned in Chapter \@ref(eda), there are two types of variables typically used in modeling:
- Quantitative (or numeric)
- Qualitative )or categorical)

Categorical variables need to be coded differently because they are not numerical in nature. As mentioned in Chapter \@ref(eda), two common coding techniques for linear regression are **reference** and **effects** coding. The interpretation of the coefficients ($\beta$'s) of these variables in a regression model depend on the specific coding used. The predictions from the model, however, will remain the same regardless of the specific coding that is used.

Let's use the example of the ```Central_Air``` variable with 2 categories - Y and N. Using reference coding, the **reference** coded variable to describe these 2 categories (with N as the reference level) would be the following:

<table>
<tr>
<td> Central Air<td> X1
<tr><td> Y<td> 1
<tr><td> N<td> 0
</table>
<caption> (\#tab:centralair)Reference variable coding for the categorical attribute _Central Air_ </caption>

The linear regression equation would be:

$$
\hat{y} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 X_1
$$

Let's see the mathematical interpretation of the coefficient $\hat{\beta}_1$. To do this, let's get the average sale price of a home prediction for a home with central air ($\hat{y}_Y$) and without central air ($\hat{y}_N$):

$$
\hat{y}_Y = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \cdot 1 = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \\
\hat{y}_N = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \cdot 0 = \hat{\beta}_0
$$

By subtracting these two equations ($\hat{y}_Y - \hat{y}_N = \hat{\beta}_1$), we can get the prediction for the average difference in price between a home with central air and without central air. This shows that in reference coding, the coefficient on each dummy variable is the average difference between that category and the reference category (the category not represented with its own variable). The math can be extended to as many categories as needed.

Using effects coding, the **effects** coded variable to describe these 2 categories (with N as the reference level) would be the following:

<table>
<tr>
<td> Central Air<td> X1
<tr><td> Y<td> 1
<tr><td> N<td> -1
</table>
<caption> (\#tab:centralair)Effects variable coding for the categorical attribute _Central Air_ </caption>

The linear regression equation would be:

$$
\hat{y} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 X_1
$$

Let's see the mathematical interpretation of the coefficient $\hat{\beta}_1$. To do this, let's get the average sale price of a home prediction for a home with central air ($\hat{y}_Y$) and without central air ($\hat{y}_N$):

$$
\hat{y}_Y = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \cdot 1 = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \\
\hat{y}_N = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \cdot -1 = \hat{\beta}_0 - \hat{\beta}_1
$$

Similar to reference coding, the coefficient $\hat{\beta}_1$ is the average difference between homes with central air and $\hat{\beta}_0$. However, what is $\hat{\beta}_0$? By taking the average of our two predictions: 

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times (\hat{y}_Y + \hat{y}_N) = \frac{1}{2} \times (\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 + \hat{\beta}_0 - \hat{\beta}_1) = \frac{1}{2} \times (2\hat{\beta}_0) = \hat{\beta}_0
$$

From this average we can get the prediction for the average difference in price between a home with central air and the average price across all homes. This shows that in effects coding, the coefficient on each dummy variable is the average difference between that category and the average price across **all** homes (including both with and without central air). The math can be extended to as many categories as needed.

Let's see an example with ```Central_Air``` as a variable added to our multiple linear regression model as a reference coded variable.

```{r}
ames_lm4 <- lm(Sale_Price ~ Gr_Liv_Area + TotRms_AbvGrd + Central_Air, data = train)

summary(ames_lm4)
```


With these results we estimate the average difference in sales price between homes with central air and without central air to be \$54,513.08.

# Model Selection {#sel}

This section will dive into some basic foundations in model selection, or finding the best model for a data set.  In most data sets, there will most likely be variables that are informative and ones that are uninformative in predicting the response.  With many explanatory variables, it could be extremely time consuming to try all potential models by hand, and the use of automatic procedures can greatly assist in obtaining subsets of variables in which to focus your attention.  
<ul>
This Chapter aims to answer the following questions:
</ul>
  <li> What are the different selection criteria that can be used in model selection? 
</ul>
  <li> How to perform a stepwise search algorithm. 
    <ul>
    <li> Forward Selection 
    <li> Backward Elimination
    <li> Stepwise Selection
</ul>
  <li> Considerations when looking at p-values.
<ul>

CAUTION: you should NEVER just use the final model created from an automatic procedure!  _Always_ explore your data (both automatically selected _and_ excluded variables), and use domain knowledge, diagnostics, and critical thought to decide on your final model.

We will focus on two techniques for automatic variable selection: stepwise procedures and LASSO. Within the stepwise procedures, we will discuss forward, backward and stepwise searches using several different selection criteria.  We will end this section discussing important considerations in use of p-values when dealing with large data sets.

## Selection Criteria

When trying to find the best model, there are many selection criteria at our disposal.  For example, you have already been introduced to $R^{2}$ (the larger the value of $R^{2}$, the better the model).  However, when comparing multivariate models, the adjusted $R^{2}$ is better due to the fact that $R^{2}$ can potentially increase even when adding noise.  The adjusted $R^{2}$ can be thought of as $R^{2}$ with penalty (for every additional variable added to the model, we add a penalty).  This allows us to weigh the contribution of adding new variables against the added complexity of more variables in the model.  There are other selection criteria that are also used in selecting the "best model" (or variable selection).  As you will notice, these selection criteria also have a penalty to take into account the addition of variables.  We will use two of the most common ones: AIC and BIC (can also be referred to as SBC).

The AIC, or __Akaike Information Criterion__, was developed by statistician Hirotugu Akaike in the 1970's and is defined by 
$$ AIC = -2log(Likelihood) + 2p.  $$  In this case, "Likelihood" is the likelihood of the data and $2p$ is the "penalty", where $p$ is the number of parameters in the model.  A smaller AIC indicates a better model.

BIC, also known as the __Bayesian Information Criterion__ (also called SBC or __Schwarz Bayesian Information__) was first developed by Gideon E. Schwarz, also back in the 1970's and is defined by
$$BIC = -2log(Likelihood) + plog(n). $$ In this case, "Likelihood" is the likelihood of the data and $plog(n)$ is the "penalty", where $p$ is the number of parameters in the model and $n$ is the sample size.  A smaller BIC indicates a better model.  Notice that both penalties have a common term of $p$ in them (this will be important to remember when we start discussing the R code). 


## Stepwise Selection

The three different algorithms in the stepwise selection search are forward, backward and stepwise.  Each of these algorithms either add or take away one variable at a time based on a given criterion until this criterion can no longer be met.  At which point the algorithm stops.  

```{r prompt=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message = FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(AmesHousing)
ames=make_ordinal_ames()
set.seed(123)
ames <- ames %>% mutate(id = row_number())
train <- ames %>% sample_frac(0.7)
test <- anti_join(ames, train, by = 'id')

train_sel = train %>% dplyr::select('Sale_Price', 
                              'Lot_Area',
                              'Street',
                              'Bldg_Type',
                              'House_Style',
                              'Overall_Qual',
                              'Roof_Style',
                              'Central_Air',
                              'First_Flr_SF',
                              'Second_Flr_SF',
                              'Full_Bath',
                              'Half_Bath',
                              'Fireplaces',
                              'Garage_Area',
                              'Gr_Liv_Area', 
                              'TotRms_AbvGrd') %>%
                      replace(is.na(.), 0)

```

### Forward {.unnumbered}

For forward selection, we start with a null model (only the intercept) and add one variable at a time until no other variables can be added based on a given criterion.  The algorithm is as follows:

0. Start with a null model, this is the base model (just the intercept)\
    1.  For each variable not in model, create a linear regression model with the base model plus this one variable \
    2.  See which linear regression is best (based on criterion)\
    3.  Is this regression better than the base model?  \
        a. Yes, then continue on to step 4\
        b. No, exit the algorithm with the base model as the chosen model\
    4.  The base model is now the previous base model plus the variable selected in step 3.  Using this as your new base model, go back to step 1 and continue.\
 
To do forward selection in R, you will use the step function.  The "empty model" should be used as your initial model (which is just the intercept).  For the scope of the model, you need to put the "smallest model" (just the intercept) to the "largest model" (full model).  The direction is forward.  The penalty can be controlled by defining "$k$".  Using a value of 2 for "$k$" will use the AIC criterion (remember AIC penalty was $2p$) and using $log(n)$ for "$k$" will use the BIC criterion (remember BIC penalty was $plog(n)$).  If you do not specify anything for "$k$", the default is AIC.  You can also define "$k$" as the upper $\alpha$-quantile of a $\chi^{2}$ distribution with one degree of freedom, which will use p-value for its selection of variables.  In this case, the best "model" is the one with the lowest p-value for the new variable.  In order to enter the model, the p-value of this variable will need to be lower than the "cut-off" for the p-values ($\alpha$), which means that the criterion to enter the model would be that the variable has a p-value smaller than $\alpha$.

```{r forward, prompt=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# Create full model and empty model
full.model <- lm(Sale_Price ~ . , data = train_sel)
empty.model <- lm(Sale_Price ~ 1, data = train_sel)

# k = 2 for AIC selection
for.model <- step(empty.model,
                  scope = list(lower = empty.model,
                               upper = full.model),
                  direction = "forward", k = 2) 

```
Below is edited output with comments to lead you through the forward selection.  Notice that the above code has $k$=2, which means we are using AIC as our selection criterion.  The first information R provides is for the initial model, which is  $$Y_{i}=\beta_{0} + \varepsilon_{i}.$$ The "empty model" has an AIC of 46,323.64 (in order for ANY variable to be added, that model must be better, or in other words have a smaller AIC than this initial model).

```
Start:  AIC=46323.64
Sale_Price ~ 1
```

R then displays all simple linear regressions with their corresponding AIC values.  Notice that R puts the information in ascending AIC values (so, the best simple linear regression is 43,817 which is indeed smaller than 46,323.64).  You will also see a line with a blank for the "variable", this is the current "base model".  In this first step, it is just the intercept.  Therefore, we will add the variable Overall_Qual.

| <none>        |                 |1.3197e+13| 46324  |

Now, R shows you the new "base model", which includes Overall_Qual (and of course the intercept is still included) and the new AIC value to beat which is 43816.66.

```
Step:  AIC=43816.66
Sale_Price ~ Overall_Qual
```

Using this as our base model, we now try adding each of the remaining variables in separate regression models, output is shown below:


|               | Df  | Sum of Sq | RSS      | AIC     |
| :-----------  | :-: | --------: | :-------: |------: |
|+Gr_Liv_Area   | 1   |9.8905e+11 | 2.8640e+12| 43210  |

|+Second_Flr_SF | 1   |1.7555e+11 | 3.6775e+12| 43723  |
|+Half_Bath     | 1   |1.3948e+11 | 3.7136e+12| 43743  |
|+Central_Air   | 1   |9.1322e+10 | 3.7617e+12| 43769  |
|+House_Style   | 7   |6.1815e+10 | 3.7912e+12| 43797  |
| +Roof_Style   | 5   |5.1448e+10 | 3.8016e+12| 43799  |
| <none>        |     |           | 3.8531e+12| 43817  |
| +Street       | 1   |1.9573e+06 | 3.8531e+12| 43819  |


Best model includes Gr_Liv_Area (in addition to the intercept and Overall_Qual).  The AIC is 43210, which beats the previous one of 43817.  So, we will add Gr_Liv_Area to the model.  Our new base model includes the intercept, Overall_Qual and Gr_Liv_Area with an AIC of 43210.

```
Step:  AIC=43210.24
Sale_Price ~ Overall_Qual + Gr_Liv_Area
```

We continue in this fashion until adding a new variable does NOT decrease the AIC.  The last step is shown below:
```
Step:  AIC=42676.1
Sale_Price ~ Overall_Qual + Gr_Liv_Area + House_Style + Garage_Area + Bldg_Type + Fireplaces 
        + Full_Bath + Half_Bath + Lot_Area + Roof_Style + Central_Air + Second_Flr_SF 
        + TotRms_AbvGrd + First_Flr_SF
```

|               | Df  | Sum of Sq | RSS       | AIC    |
| :-----------  | :-: | --------: | :-------: |------: |
| <none>        |     |           | 2.1542e+12| 42676  |
| +Street       |1    | 1.028e+09 | 2.1532e+12| 42677  |


Notice that the previous step had a model with the intercept, Overall_Qual, Gr_Liv_Area, House_Style, Garage_Area, 
Bldg_Type, Fireplaces, Full_Bath, Half_Bath, Lot_Area, Roof_Style, Central_Air, Second_Flr_SF, TotRms_AbvGrd, and First_Flr_SF (as illustrated by the above formula).  The AIC for this model is 42676.1.  There is only one variable left that could be added (Street).  However, when we add street to the model, the AIC now becomes 42677 (in other words AIC increases, which is a worse model).  The algorithm stops here.

The code below illustrates how to do forward selection with BIC and p-values.  In the output from R, it still says "AIC", but now these values are calculated by using the BIC formula or the corresponding "$k$" values for p-values (take a look at the values R has for the "AIC" column and you will see that it has changed!).


```{r other forward options, prompt=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

# k = log(n) for BIC selection
for.model2 <- step(empty.model,
                   scope = list(lower = empty.model,
                               upper = full.model),
                   direction = "forward", k = log(nrow(train_sel))) # k = qchisq(alpha, 1, lower.tail = FALSE) for p-value with alpha selection
alpha.f=0.05
for.model3 <- step(empty.model,
                   scope = list(lower = empty.model,
                                upper = full.model),
                   direction = "forward", k = qchisq(alpha.f, 1, lower.tail = FALSE)) 

```


### Backward {.unnumbered}

Backward elimination starts with the "base" model as the full model (i.e. all variables are contained within the model).  We remove only one variable and we do this for each variable in the model.  We want to see if the any of the models improve over the "base model" (in other words, is the model better with that one variable removed based on a given criterion?).  If this new model (with that one variable removed) is better than the previous model, then we remove that variable and this new model now becomes the base model. We are looking for the best improvement, therefore we look at the model that would be the best over the base model. The algorithm continues in this fashion until no other variables can be removed, based on the chosen criterion. 

0. Start with full model with all predictor variables in it, this is the base model and calculate the criterion on this model\
    1.  Create models such that each model has exactly one predictor variable removed from it and calculate the criterion for each model \
    2.  In step 1, find the best model based on the criterion\
    3.  Is this regression model better than the base model?  \
        a. Yes, then continue on to step 4\
        b. No, exit the algorithm with the base model as the chosen model\
    4.  The base model is now the model with the variable removed. Using this as your new base model, go back to step 1 and continue.\

To do backward elimination in R, you will use the step function.  The "full model" should be used as your initial model (which is the model with all the predictor variables in it).  For the scope of the model, you need to put the "smallest model" (just the intercept) to the "largest model" (full model).  The direction is backward.  The penalty (which indicates the criteria) can be controlled by defining "$k$".  As discussed before, a value of 2 will use the AIC criterion, a value of $log(n)$ will produce the BIC penalty, and finally the upper $\alpha$-quantile of a $\chi^{2}$ distribution with one degree of freedom will use p-value for its removal of variables.  

```{r backward, prompt=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# Create full model and empty model
full.model <- lm(Sale_Price ~ . , data = train_sel)
empty.model <- lm(Sale_Price ~ 1, data = train_sel)

# k = 2 for AIC selection
back.model <- step(full.model,
                  scope = list(lower = empty.model,
                               upper = full.model),
                  direction = "backward", k = 2) 

```

Below is edited output with comments to lead you through the backward elimination.  Notice that the above code has $k$=2, which means we are using AIC as our selection criterion.  The first information R provides is for the initial model, which is  $$Y_{i}=\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{i,1}+\beta_{2}x_{i,2}+\beta_{3}x_{i,3}+\beta_{4}x_{i,4}+\beta_{5}x_{i,5}+\beta_{6}x_{i,6}+\beta_{i,7}x_{7}+\beta_{8}x_{i,8}+\beta_{9}x_{i,9}+\beta_{10}x_{i,10}+\beta_{11}x_{i,11}+\beta_{12}x_{i,12}+\beta_{13}x_{i,13}+\beta_{14}x_{i,14}+\beta_{15}x_{i,15}+\varepsilon_{i}.$$ The "full model" has an AIC of 42,677.12 (in order for ANY variable to be removed, that model must be better, or in other words have a smaller AIC than this initial model).

R then displays linear regression models with one variable removed and their corresponding AIC values.  For example, if we remove Street (just that one variable), the AIC of that model will be 42675. Notice that R put the information in ascending AIC values (so, best linear regression is at the top with an AIC value of 42,675 which is indeed smaller than 42,677.12, so Street will be removed).  You will also see a line with <none>.  This is the "base model", or in this case the full model.

Once Street is removed, the new "base model" (without this variable) has an AIC value of 42,674.6.  This is now the new value to beat.  Repeating this process with removing the other variables one at a time, we see the output:


|               | Df | Sum of Sq | RSS       | AIC      |

Notice that none of the removal of variables is better than the "base model" based on the AIC (best one is TotRms_AbvGrd and that has an AIC of 42675, which is not better than the base model).  Since none of the removals improve the model, the algorithm stops here with all variables in the model except Street. A quick note here: notice that backward elimination selected the same model as forward selection.  This will not always be the case! Therefore, the final model is:

```
Step:  AIC=42674.6
Sale_Price ~ Lot_Area + Bldg_Type + House_Style + Overall_Qual + 
    Roof_Style + Central_Air + First_Flr_SF + Second_Flr_SF + 
    Full_Bath + Half_Bath + Fireplaces + Garage_Area + TotRms_AbvGrd
```

The code below illustrates how to do backward elimination with BIC and p-values.  


```{r other backward options, prompt=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

# k = log(n) for BIC selection
back.model2 <- step(full.model,
                   scope = list(lower = empty.model,
                               upper = full.model),
                   direction = "backward", k = log(nrow(train_sel))) # k = qchisq(alpha, 1, lower.tail = FALSE) for p-value with alpha selection
alpha.f=0.05
back.model3 <- step(full.model,
                   scope = list(lower = empty.model,
                                upper = full.model),
                   direction = "backward", k = qchisq(alpha.f, 1, lower.tail = FALSE)) 

```


### Stepwise {.unnumbered}


Stepwise selection is a combination of both of these methods.  In this algorithm, we start with the "base model" as the empty model (i.e. just the intercept) and will add variables (as in forward selection).  However, as we add new variables, we will also check that the variables in the model are still contributing (in other words, after a new variable is added, we check to see if the model would be better if we drop one of the other variables in the model). Keep in mind that this algorithm is similar to forward selection and backward elimination in that only one variable may either enter or be removed at each step.  The algorithm stops when no more variables can be added to nor taken away from the model (in other words, the current "base model" is better than adding any single addition of one variable or any single extraction of one variable).  The addition and removal of variables is again based upon the criteria specified. See the algorithm below:   

0. Start with empty model with only the intercept in it, this is the base model and calculate the criterion on this model\
    1.  For each variable not in model, create a linear regression model with the base model plus this variable; create additional models with the base model taking away one variable at a time \
    2.  See which linear regression is best (based on criterion)\
    3.  Is this regression better than the base model?  \
        a. Yes, then continue on to step 4\
        b. No, exit the algorithm with the base model as the chosen model\
    4.  The base model is now the best model selected in step 3.  Using this as your new base model, go back to step 1 and continue.\


To do stepwise selection in R, you will use the step function.  The "empty model" should be used as your initial model.  For the scope of the model, you need to put the "smallest model" (just the intercept) to the "largest model" (full model).  The direction is both.  The penalty (which indicates the criteria) can be controlled by defining "$k$".  As discussed before, a value of 2 will use the AIC criterion, a value of $log(n)$ will produce the BIC penalty, and finally the upper $\alpha$-quantile of a $\chi^{2}$ distribution with one degree of freedom will use p-value for its removal of variables.  


```{r stepwise, prompt=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# Create full model and empty model
full.model <- lm(Sale_Price ~ . , data = train_sel)
empty.model <- lm(Sale_Price ~ 1, data = train_sel)

# k = 2 for AIC selection
step.model <- step(empty.model,
                  scope = list(lower = empty.model,
                               upper = full.model),
                  direction = "both", k = 2) 

```

As you can see, the initial base model is just the intercept (AIC=46,323.64).  From this initial model, all simple linear regressions are created and the AIC is observed.

```
Start:  AIC=46323.64
Sale_Price ~ 1
```

As you can see from the above output, the "best" model is the one containing Overall_Qual.  Therefore, the new base model is the one containing just this variable. \ 

Using this as the new base model, we look at adding each of the individual variables to this model (see output below), as well as taking away the variables in the model (in this case, just Overall_Qual).  From the output, you can see a "+" for when a variable is being added and a "-" for when a variable is being taken away.

```
Step:  AIC=43816.66
Sale_Price ~ Overall_Qual

The best model is now the one adding `Gr_Liv_Area` to the old base model that just included `Overall_Qual`.  This becomes the new base model and the algorithm continues below..

```

As you can see from the above stepwise procedures of forward, backward and stepwise, the algorithms attempt to find the "best model" by either adding one variable or taking away one variable at at a time.  There is no guarantee that these algorithms will find the best model, but they do provide some guidance in terms of potential significance variables and can provide assistance when the number of variables under consideration is very large.  As a caution though, you should always do further investigation once you have found models through these algorithms.  These algorithms can give the same models or different models as their final selection based on the algorithm selected and the criteria used.

## Significance Levels

If you are going to use the "p-value" method, you need to be aware of some considerations due to sample size.  The larger the sample size, the smaller the p-values will be and the more likely it is that you will end up seeing many "significant" p-values due to the relationship between p-values and sample size (not necessarily because that variable was informative).  The paper by Raftery on the Moodle page sums up the problem nicely and provides at least some guidance in terms of potential alpha-levels to use for different sample sizes.  A summary of the table is provided below.

|Evidence   |30   | 50   |100   |  1000  |
| :-------  |----:| ----:|----: |-------:|
|Weak       |0.076| 0.53 |0.032 | 0.009  |
|Fair       |0.028| 0.019|0.010 | 0.003  |
|Strong     |0.005| 0.003|0.001 | 0.0003 |
|Very Strong|0.001|0.0005|0.0001| 0.00004|


You can quickly see that for even sample sizes of 1000, one should consider the value of alpha that is used to determine significance. One thing that most researchers agree on is that considerations need to be taken for larger sample size.  However, what those considerations should be and exactly how to do that is not agreed upon.  You should consider your sample size when you are determining what level of significance you want to choose for your analysis (also take into account which is worse....a type I error or a type II error).  There is no quick answer to this question and each decision will depend on the analysis being conducted.

# Diagnostics {#diag}

In this Chapter, we will take a look at each of the assumptions in a linear model.  We will discuss what tools you will use to assess these assumptions, how to diagnose if the assumptions are met, some common problems often encountered when these assumptions do not hold and finally some remedies to fix these common issues.  You will notice that a variety of data sets are used throughout this Chapter. This is to help visualize and test for various assumptions and how to identify when these assumptions are not met.

<ul>
This Chapter aims to answer the following questions:
</ul>
  <li> How to use residuals from a multiple linear regression model to assess the assumptions.
</ul>
  <ul>
  <li> Does the mean of the response have a linear pattern in the explanatory variables?
  <li> Do the residuals have a constant variance? 
  <li> Are the residuals normally distributed? 
  <li> Are the residuals independent?
</ul>
  <li> How to identify potential outliers and influential points.
</ul> 
  <li> How to identify potential multicolliearity.
<ul>

In multiple linear regression, the assumptions are as follows:

  1. The mean of the Y's is accurately modeled by a linear function of the X's.\
  2. The random error term, $\varepsilon$, is assumed to have a normal distribution with a mean of zero.\
  3. The random error term, $\varepsilon$, is assumed to have a constant variance, $\sigma^{2}$. \
  4. The errors are independent. \
  5. No perfect collinearity. \
  
Before exploring the assumptions of a linear model, it is always good to visually take a look at your data (if it is not too large).  The `pairs` command in R allows you to look at all scatterplots between the variables in a data set.  
  
To illustrate this, we will use the Salaries data set in the package carData in R that has 397 observations of salaries for professors.  The explanatory variables include:

<ul> 
<li> _rank_: a factor with levels AssocProf, AsstProf, Prof
<li> _discipline_: a factor with levels A (“theoretical” departments) or B (“applied” departments)
<li> _yrs.since.phd_: years since PhD
<li> _yrs.service_: years of service
<li> _sex_: a factor with levels Female and Male
<li> _salary_: nine-month salary, in dollars
</ul>
Using this data set, let's take a look at the relationship between each pair of variables in Figure \@ref(fig:pairsex).


```{r fig=T, label='pairsex', fig.align='center',fig.cap='Matrix of Scatter Plots for the Salaries Data', prompt=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(carData)
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
library(grid)
library(lattice)
library(nortest)
library(MASS)
library(TSA)
library(lmtest)
library(car)
pairs(Salaries)

```
If there are not too many variables, this plot is a nice way to see all the relationships in the data set.  The variables are listed along the diagonal and each off diagonal plot is a scatterplot of the variables represented by that row and column.  For example, the first row of plots have rank on the y-axis.  The first column of plots have rank along the x-axis.

## Examining Residuals

As you can see from the above list of assumptions that most of them involve the error term which is estimated by the residuals.  We will be using the residuals for many of these diagnostics.  One of the most useful plot is referred as the residual plot.  This plot will have the residuals along the y-axis and either the predicted values or individual x-values along the x-axis.  Figure \ref@(fig:salresid) is an example using the residuals from a linear model predicting salary using all of the explanatory variables. 

```{r label='salresid', fig=T, prompt=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message = FALSE, echo=TRUE, fig.cap = 'Residuals vs. Predicted Values for Salary Model'}

lm.model=lm(salary~.,data=Salaries)

ggplot(lm.model,aes(x=fitted(lm.model),y=resid(lm.model)))+geom_point(color="blue")+labs(x="Predicted Values",y="Residuals")

```

## Misspecified Model

One of the assumptions assumes that the expected value of the response is accurately modeled by a linear function of the explanatory variables.  If this is true, then we would expect our residual plots to be random scatter (in other words, all of the "signal" was correctly captured in the model and there is just noise left over).

```{r label='correctspec', prompt=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message = FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = 'Ideal residual plot showing residual values randomly distributed with equal variance'}

y=rnorm(1000,0,4)
x=seq(1,1000)
temp=data.frame(cbind(x,y))

ggplot(temp,aes(x=x,y=y))+geom_point(color="orange")+labs(x="Predicted Values",y="Residuals")

```

Looking at the plot in Figure \@ref(fig:correctspec), we see that there is no pattern.  If you did see some type of pattern in this residual plot, it would indicate that you are missing something and need to do some more modeling.  For example, a quadratic shape or curvilinear pattern to the residuals would indicate that one of our input variables has a nonlinear relationship to the response and transformations should be made to that input accordingly. For example, a residual scatter plot like Figure \@ref(fig:quadpattern) would prompt us to consider a quadratic term. 

```{r fig=T, fig.align='center', fig.cap = 'Residual plot indicating that a quadratic term is required', label='quadpattern', prompt=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message = FALSE, echo=FALSE }
x=seq(1,1000)
y=2-0.00001*(x-500)^2+rnorm(1000)
temp=data.frame(cbind(x,y))
ggplot(temp,aes(x=x,y=y))+geom_point(color="blue")+labs(x="X",y="Residuals")
```
If your model has more than one x, it is easier to see if an individual input variable has a quadratic relationship with the response when looking at plots like Figure \@ref(fig:quadpattern) where the input variable is on the x-axis. 

**Example**

Let's take a look at an example of where a quadratic linear regression is needed. This example is studying the effect of a chemical additive on paper strength.  The response variable is the amount of force required to break the paper (strength) and the explanatory variable is the amount of chemical additive (amount).


```{r fig=T, fig.align='center', fig.cap = 'Residual Plot Showing a Quadratic Relationship', label='quadexample1', prompt=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message = FALSE, echo=TRUE}

 amount=c(1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5)
 strength=c(2.4,2.6,2.7,2.5,2.6,2.6,2.7,2.8,2.8,2.8,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.9,2.9,3.0,3.1,2.9,2.9,3.0,2.9,2.8)
 lm.quad=lm(strength~amount)
 summary(lm.quad)
 ggplot(lm.quad,aes(x=amount,y=resid(lm.quad)))+geom_point(color="blue",size=3)+labs( x="Amount", y="Residuals")

```

The above fitted model is 
$$\hat{Y}_{i} = 2.5 + 0.1x_{i}.$$
However, after looking at the residual plot and noticing the quadratic shape, we realize that we need a higher order term for amount.


```{r fig=T, fig.align='center', fig.cap = 'New Residual Plot after Fitting a Quadratic Term', label='quadexample2', prompt=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message = FALSE, echo=TRUE}

lm.quad=lm(strength~amount + I(amount^2))

summary(lm.quad)
ggplot(lm.quad,aes(x=amount,y=resid(lm.quad)))+geom_point(color="orange",size=2)+labs(title="Residual plot", x="Amount", y="Residuals")

```
The second order polynomial model is 
$$\hat{Y}_{i} = 2.21 + 0.33x_{i}-0.04x^{2}_{i}$$
and the residuals from this model are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:quadexample2). If you think there might still be some pattern in Figure \@ref(fig:quadexample2), you could try a third degree polynomial:


```{r fig=T, fig.align='center', fig.cap = 'New Residual Plot after Fitting a Cubic Term', label='quadexample3', prompt=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message = FALSE, echo=TRUE}


lm.3=lm(strength~amount+I(amount^2)+I(amount^3))

summary(lm.3)
ggplot(lm.3,aes(x=amount,y=resid(lm.3)))+geom_point(color="orange",size=2)+labs(x="Amount", y="Residuals")

```
The new regression equation is now
$$\hat{Y}_{i} = 2.73 - 0.37x_{i}+0.22x^{2}_{i}-0.03x^{3}_{i}.$$

In wrapping up the misspecified model, if a linear model does not look appropriate (there is a pattern in the residual plot), then you can try the following remedies:

  1. Fit a polynomial or more complex regression model.\
  2. Transform the dependent and/or independent variables to obtain linearity.\
  3. Fit a nonlinear regression model, if appropriate (will need to decide the shape of a nonlinear model).\
  4. Fit a nonparametric regression model (for example splines or a LOESS regression).\


## Constant Variance

Another assumption for linear regression is that the variance is constant about the line.  Looking at Figure \@ref(fig:constvar), you see that the variation about the line is constant across the line (notice the bands that have been drawn around the line).

```{r fig=T, fig.align='center',fig.cap ='Residual Plot Showing Non-Constant Variance', label='constvar', prompt=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message = FALSE, echo=FALSE}


x=seq(1,50)
y=rnorm(50,0,7)
temp=data.frame(cbind(x,y,rep(0,50),rep(-10,50),rep(10,50)))
colnames(temp)=c("x","y","fit","lwr","upr")

ggplot(temp,aes(x=x,y=y,color = "orange")) +
     geom_point(show.legend = FALSE) +
     geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lwr, ymax = upr, fill="orange", alpha=0.05,color = NULL),show.legend = FALSE) +
     geom_line( aes(y = 0), size = 1,show.legend = FALSE)+labs(title = "Constant Variance", x="Predicted Values", y="Residuals" )

```

However, an example of where this is not true is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:nonconstvar).

```{r fig=T, fig.align='center',fig.cap = 'Residual Plot Showing Non-Constant Variance', label='nonconstvar', prompt=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message = FALSE, echo=FALSE}
x=seq(1,50)
y=vector(length=50)
lwr=vector(length=50)
upr=vector(length=50)
for (i in 1:50)
{lwr[i]=3*i
upr[i]=-3*i
y[i]=rnorm(1,0,2*i)}
temp=data.frame(cbind(x,y,rep(0,50),lwr,upr))
colnames(temp)=c("x","y","fit","lwr","upr")

ggplot(temp,aes(x=x,y=y,color = "blue")) +
     geom_point(show.legend = FALSE,color="blue") +
     geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lwr, ymax = upr, fill="blue", alpha=0.05,color = "blue"),show.legend = FALSE,fill="blue",color="blue") +
     geom_line(aes(y = 0,color="blue"), color="blue",size = 1,show.legend = FALSE)+labs( x="Predicted Values", y="Residuals" )

```
 
Notice how the variability increases as the predicted values increase (the bands get wider).  This is referred to as heteroskedasticity in the variance, which violates the constant variance assumption (homoskedasticity).  The homoskedastic assumption is about the regression line, so it is best to look at the plot of residuals versus predicted values (not individual x-values).  There are a few tests for this assumption, but they are limited in what they are able to test.  Best way to evaluate this assumption is by visualizing the residual plot and make a judgement call.  If the variance appears to be heteroskadastic, any inferences under the traditional assumptions will be incorrect.  In other words, hypothesis tests and confidence intervals based on the t, F, and $\chi^{2}$ distributions will not be valid.

**Example**

The following fictious salary data set is from the online textbook [_Applied Statistics with R_](https://daviddalpiaz.github.io/appliedstats/index.html).  The explanatory variable is number of years employment and the response variable is annual salary.

```{r fig=T, fig.align='center',fig.cap = 'Residuals With Heteroskedasticity',label='varexample', prompt=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
years=c(1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,10,10,10,10,11,11,11,11,12,12,12,12,13,13,13,13,14,14,14,14,15,15,15,15,16,16,16,16,17,17,17,17,17,18,18,18,18,19,19,19,19,20,20,20,20,21,21,21,21,22,22,22,22,23,23,23,23,24,24,24,24,25,25,25)

salary=c(41504,32619,44322,40038,46147,38447,38163,42104,25597,39599,55698,47220,65929,55794,45959,52460,60308,61458,56951,56174,59363,57642,69792,59321,66379,64282,48901,100711,59324,54752,73619,65382,58823,65717,92816,72550,71365,88888,62969,45298,111292,91491,106345,99009,73981,72547,74991,139249,119948,128962,98112,97159,125246,89694,73333,108710,97567,90359,119806,101343,147406,153020,143200,97327,184807,146263,127925,159785,174822,177610,210984,160044,137044,182996,184183,168666,121350,193627,142611,170131,134140,129446,201469,202104,220556,166419,149044,247017,247730,252917,235517,241276,197229,175879,253682,262578,207715,221179,212028,312549)

lm.var=lm(salary~years)

ggplot(lm.var,aes(x=fitted(lm.var),y=resid(lm.var)))+geom_point(color="blue")+labs(title="Residual Plot", x="Predicted Values",y="Residuals")

```
As you can see from the residual plot in Figure \@ref(fig:varexample), the graph exhibits a fan-shape and the variance is increasing as the predicted values get larger.  We can apply a logarithmic transform to try to stabilize the variance, the result of which is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:correctexam).

```{r fig=T, fig.align='center',fig.cap ='Residual Plot Showing Stabilized Variance after Log Transform', label='correctexam', prompt=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message = FALSE, echo=FALSE}


lm.var=lm(log(salary)~years)

ggplot(lm.var,aes(x=fitted(lm.var),y=resid(lm.var)))+geom_point(color="orange")+labs( x="Predicted Values",y="Residuals")

```

The log transform stabilized the variance and produces a better residual plot.

If the assumption of Homoskadicity of variance is violated, there are a few remedies you can try:
  1. Use Weighted Least Squares (WLS) or iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS).\
  2. Transform data.\
  3. Use a different distribution (for example if the response is count data, use Poisson distribution).\


## Normality

Another assumption is that the residuals are normally distributed.  We can test this assumption through use of visual aids or formal hypothesis tests. visual aids include a histogram of the residuals or Q-Q plot of residuals.  A few tests of normality of residuals, include (but not limited to) Shapiro-Wilk, Anderson-Darling, Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests.  In addition to the base R package, you should also install and library the nortest package.

**Visualization**

To visually inspect whether or not the residuals are normally distributed, we can either graph the historgram of residuals or create a Q-Q plot of the residuals. In the histogram, we are looking for a bell-shaped curve and in the Q-Q plot, we are looking for a straight line.

```{r fig=T,fig.align='center',label ='normalvis',fig.cap = 'Histogram and Q-Q Plot of Residuals', prompt=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message = FALSE, echo=FALSE}

x=rnorm(1000,0,4)
h=qplot(x, geom="histogram", 
      xlab = "Age",  
      fill=I("orange"))
xdf=data.frame(x)
q=ggplot(data = xdf, aes(sample = x)) +
  stat_qq() +
  stat_qq_line()

grid.arrange(h,q,ncol=2)
```

**Formal Hypothesis tests**

You can also run a formal hypothesis test.  The hypotheses are  
$H_{0}:$ Residuals are normally distributed  
$H_{A}:$ Residuals are not normally distributed.  

There are MANY different tests for normality.  Only two will be covered here.

1. Anderson-Darling is based on the empirical cumulative distribution function of the data and gives more weight to the tails.   
2. Shapiro-Wilk test uses the idea of correlation between the sample data and normal scores.  The Shapiro-Wilk is better for smaller data sets.  


With large samples, you will most likely end up rejecting these hypothesis tests (using corrected significance levels is recommended).  Keep in mind that you can also get different result from different tests.  It is up to you to make the decision on whether or not you are comfortable in the assumption for normality holding in different situations.

```{r normal_test, prompt=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message = FALSE, echo=TRUE}

set.seed(55402)
x=rnorm(1000,0,4)
ad.test(x)
shapiro.test(x)

```

Using a simulated data set (so the "TRUE" distribution is actually normal indicating that we should "Fail to reject" the null hypothesis).  The p-values from both of these test illustrate that they would indicate the distribution is not significantly different from normal (which it should).

**Box-cox Transformation**

If the residuals are not normally distributed, one solution is to transform them to normality.  However, the exact transformation might be difficult to identify.  George Box and Sir David Cox developed an algorithm back in the 1960's to assist in identifying "power" transformations to make a variable normally distributed (think..."what power should I raise this variable to?").  Their algorithm tries out different values of $\lambda$ or powers of the response variable in the following way:\

 
$$y = \begin{array}
{rr}
\frac{y^{\lambda}-1}{\lambda} & if \lambda \ne 0  \\
log(y) & if \lambda = 0 
\end{array}$$   

**Example**

Using the residuls from the originally salary data, we can take a look at the box-cox transformation.

```{r boxcox, prompt=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message = FALSE, echo=TRUE}


lm.var=lm(salary~years)

boxcox(lm.var)

```
The output from the graph clearly incates that $\lambda$ should be 0, which indicates a log transform.

In conclusion, to deal with data that is NOT normally distributed, we can either\
1. Use a robust regression (quantile regression or nonparametric)\
2. Transform either response or predictor variables or both to obtain normality in the residuals.\

## Correlated Errors
Another important assumption is that the observations are independent.  There are a couple of ways in which we assess this assumtpion:\

1. Experimental design or collection of data\
2. Explore residual plots\

Depending on how the data was collected or the experimental design, there could be potential correlation in the observations.  For example, if the data collected information on multiple family members (include husband and wife and kids).  Or if multiple observations were collected on the same subject.  There are various models that exists that can account for this dependence (longitudinal analysis, hierarchical models, etc).  However, this type of analysis will be covered later throughout the year.  There is no diagnostic measures to indicate this correlation structure.  Your best way of knowing it is there is to know the experimental design or collection of data.\  
We will focus our attention on a form of dependence that is evident from the residual plots, which is autocorrelation.  This happens when ordered observations are dependent on prior observations.  One of the most common instances of this correlation structure is through data that is collected over time, also referred to as time series.  You will learn more about time series data in the Fall semester, but for now, let's explore how to recognize if it is an issue in the analysis.  To diagnose autocorrelation in data, you can \

1. Visually inspect the plot of residuals by time (see a pattern over time...usually cyclical)\
2. Conduct a Durbin-Watson test\

In visually inspecting a plot of residuals across time, you would expect to see a type of cyclical pattern if autocorrelation exists as it does in Figure \@ref(fig:autoplot).

```{r autoplot, fig=T, fig.align='center',fig.cap = 'Residuals vs Time: Autocorrelation Present',label='autoplot', prompt=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message = FALSE, echo=FALSE}


set.seed(49205)
error1=rnorm(50)
x=seq(1,50)
y=sin(2*pi*x/12)+error1
temp=data.frame(cbind(x,y))
ggplot(temp,aes(x=x,y=y))+geom_point(color="blue")+labs( x="Time",y="Residuals")+geom_smooth(method = "lm",formula = y ~ sin(2*pi*x/12), size = 1)

```

In using the Durbin-Watson test, the hypotheses are:\
$H_{0}:$ No residual correlation\
$H_{A}:$ Residual Correlation\

The Durbin-Watson test statistic is calculated by 

$$ d=\frac{\sum_{t=2}^T(e_{t}-e_{t-1})^2}{\sum_{t=1}^T e_{t}^2}$$
where $e$ represents the error terms, or residuals.  The statistic *d* ranges from 0 to 4, with a value of 2 indicating no residual correlation. Values of *d* smaller than 2 may indicate a positive autocorrelation and a value of *d* larger than 2 may indicate a negative autocorrelation.  However, the question becomes when is it "significantly different" than 2?  Unless there is good reason to assume a negative autocorrelation, testing for positive autocorrelation would be the preferred test.  The Durbin-Watson test is in the lmtest package of R. If you want to test for positive autocorrelation, you will need to specify the alternative of "greater" (even though the test statistic is testing for a value LESS than 2!!).\

**Example**
The following data set illustrates this test using the Google data set in the TSA package (returns of Google stock from 08/20/04 - 09/13/06).

```{r auto_test, prompt=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message = FALSE, echo=TRUE}


data(google)
x=seq(1,length(google))
lm.model=lm(google~x)
dwtest(lm.model,alternative="greater")

```
In running this test, you either need to have the data sorted by the correct date (it assumes the observations are correctly ordered by time).  If they are not, there is an order.by option in which you can use.  For this example, the p-value is 0.0321, which if we use an $\alpha$ of 0.05, we would reject the null hypothesis and conclude there appears to be significant positive autocorrelation.

If your data has significant autocorrelation, then the error terms will not be correct.  We will discuss in the Fall semester how to model time series data appropriately.

## Influential Observations and Outliers

Influential points and outliers play a large role in the estimation of the model and its prediction.  Influential points are usually those points on the edges of the x-values and can greatly impact the slopes in the regression equation.  Outliers tend to be those values that do not follow the trend of the data and are generally found by large deviations in the y direction.  For multiple linear regression, outliers are found by using residuals. These can be standardize residuals or studentized residuals.  Influential points can be discovered by Cook's D, dffits, dfbetas or Hat values.  These points are important to identify and recognize their influence on the regression, however, it does NOT mean that these points should be removed. Removal of data should be taken very seriously. We would obviously want to omit any observations made in error, due to typos or reporting inaccuracies, but we do not remove data points just because they are outside the scope of our expectations. We have many tools at our disposal for modeling with such observations, and we should always develop a deep understanding of the application-specific risks and rewards associated with data removal. \

In the this section we will cover the following statistics to help us detect outliers and influential observations respectively. 

*Outliers*\
rstandard\
rstudent\
*Influential observations*\
dffits\
dfbetas\
cooks.distance\
hatvalues\



*Outliers*\
In using residuals to detect outliers, we first need to "standardize" them, or divide by their standard errors.  In this sense, we can think of these "standardized" residuals as an approximate z-score.  Therefore, we look for residuals greater in magnitude than 3 as potential outliers.  R calculates two different types of standardized residuals: 1. internally studentized residuals and 2. externally studentized residuals.  Internally studentized residuals are definied as
$$ r_{i}=\frac{e_{i}}{\hat\sigma\sqrt{1-H_{ii}}},$$
where $\hat\sigma$ is the square root of the MSE and $H_{ii}$ is from the diagonal of the hat matrix (hat matrix will be discussed in influential observations).  In R, these are denoted by rstandard.  Externally studentized residuals are definied as
$$ t_{i}=\frac{e_{i}}{\hat\sigma_{(i)}\sqrt{1-H_{ii}}},$$
where $\hat\sigma_{(i)}$ is the square root of the MSE calculated when observation *i* is deleted and $H_{ii}$ is from the diagonal of the hat matrix.  The externally studentized residuals follow a t-distribution with $n-k-2$, where $k$ is the number of explanatory variables(notice that this has one less degree of freedom than the usual error in regression which is due to the one deleted observation).  The R code to obtain externally studentized residuals is rstudent.

*Influential observations*\
Influential observations are observations that can dramatically change the model's estimates.  It is important to identify and understand these where these observations are.  There are a number of different measures to aid in identifying influential observations, which will be discussed below.   

Cook's distance, also referred to as Cook's D, measures the difference in the regression estimates when the $i^{th}$ observation is left out.  A rough rule of thumb used as a cutoff is if $D_{i}$  is greater than $\frac{4}{n-p-1}$.   

Dffits calculates the difference of fitted values for each point in the regression versus the fit of the regression line for that point if it was removed.  Large values of dffits indicate that the point is influential in the calculation of the estimated regression line. As a general rule of thumb, a cutoff of $2\sqrt{(p+1)/n}$ is used to identify potential influential points.\
Dfbetas follows the same idea as dffits.  The difference in the estimated betas is calculated for each observation (observation included in the estimated beta and observation NOT included in estimating the beta).  This is done for each individual observation and each estimated beta. For small data sets, a value greater than 1 is suspect of an influential observation.  For large data sets, the cutoff is $\frac{2}{\sqrt{n}}$.\
The hat values $H_{ii}$ are the diagonal values of $$\boldsymbol{X(X^{T}X)^{-1.}X^{T}}.$$  Hat values can identify high leverage points in a regression.  A general rule of thumb are hat values greater than $\frac{2(p+1)}{n}$.

**Example**
We will use the Scottish hill races as an example to illustrate how to calculate and visualize these values.  The Scottish hill races include the following variables:\
Time:	Record time to complete course\
Distance:	Distance in the course\
Climb:	Vertical climb in the course\

```{r influence, fig=T, fig.align='center',fig.cap = 'Plots for Exploring Outliers and Influential Points',label='influence', prompt=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message = FALSE, echo=TRUE}


url = 'http://www.statsci.org/data/general/hills.txt'

lm.model=lm(Time~Distance+Climb,data=races.table)


##Plots of outliers
a = ggplot(lm.model,aes(x=n.index,y=rstandard(lm.model)))+geom_point(color="orange")+geom_line(y=-3)+geom_line(y=3)+labs(title = "Internal Studentized Residuals",x="Observation",y="Residuals")

b = ggplot(lm.model,aes(x=n.index,y=rstudent(lm.model)))+geom_point(color="orange")+geom_line(y=-3)+geom_line(y=3)+labs(title = "External Studentized Residuals",x="Observation",y="Residuals")

##Cook's D
D.cut=4/(nrow(races.table)-3-1)

db.cut=2/sqrt(nrow(races.table))


f =ggplot(lm.model,aes(x=n.index,y=dfbetas(lm.model)[,'Climb']))+geom_point(color="orange")+geom_line(y=db.cut)+geom_line(y=-db.cut)+labs(title = "DFBETA for Climb",x="Observation",y="DFBETAS")

g =ggplot(lm.model,aes(x=n.index,y=dfbetas(lm.model)[,'Distance']))+geom_point(color="orange")+geom_line(y=db.cut)+geom_line(y=-db.cut)+labs(title = "DFBETA for Distance",x="Observation",y="DFBETAS")

##Hat

grid.arrange(a,b,c,d,e,f,g,ncol=2)
```

Figure \@ref(fig:influence) shows a number of useful graphics that help us explore outliers and influential points. 

A good graph to explore is looking at the external studentized residuals versus the hat values.  An observation that is high leverage AND an outlier is one that needs to be explored.

```{r fig=T, fig.align='center',fig.cap = 'Influential and Outlier Observations',label='influenceresid', prompt=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(lm.model,aes(x=hatvalues(lm.model),y=rstudent(lm.model))) +  geom_point(color="orange")+ labs(x="Hat values",y="Residuals")
```


## Multicollinearity

Multicollinearity occurs when one or more predictor variables are linearly related to each other and will create issues with the regression.  The parameter estimates will not be stable and the standard errors will be inflated (making it more difficult to find significant explantory variables).  The two most common ways to identify multicollinearity is by looking at the correlation among the predictor variables and calculating the variance inflation factor.   

The variance inflation factor (also referred to as VIF) will take each explanatory variable and model it as a linear regression of the remaining explanatory variables.  For example, let's say we have the following regression equation:   
$$\widehat{Y}_{i}=b_{0} + b_{1}x_{1}+ b_{2}x_{2}+ b_{3}x_{3}.$$
There are only 3 explanatory variables in this regression.  A VIF will be calculated on each $x_{i}$ in the following manner:   

1. A regression is fit on each $x_{i}$ with the remaining $x_{i}$'s as the explanatory variables.  For example, to calculate the VIF for $x_{1}$, we fit the following model:   
$$\widehat{x}_{1}=b_{0} + b_{1}x_{2}+ b_{2}x_{3},$$ 
and obtain the $R^2$ value from this model (call it $R_{1}^2$).   
2.  The VIF for $x_{1}$ is calculated by 
$$VIF=\frac{1}{1-R_{1}^2}.$$
Repeat this process for each of the other explanatory variables.  If a VIF value is larger than 10, then we say that multicollinearity is an issue.

**Example**

We will use the mtcars data set dealing with fuel consumption and automobile design.  The data set consists of the following variables:   

A data frame with 32 observations on 11 (numeric) variables.

mpg:	Miles/(US) gallon   
cyl:	Number of cylinders   
disp:	Displacement (cu.in.)   
hp:	Gross horsepower   
drat:	Rear axle ratio   
wt:	Weight (1000 lbs)   
qsec:	1/4 mile time   
vs:	Engine (0 = V-shaped, 1 = straight)   
am:	Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)   
gear:	Number of forward gears   

```{r mult_coll, prompt=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message = FALSE, echo=TRUE}

cor(mtcars)
lm.model=lm(mpg~.,data=mtcars)
vif(lm.model)
```

From the correlation output and VIF output, it is clear that multicollinearity is an issue.  To deal with multicollinearity, we can do either of the following:   

1.  Remove one or more variables that are co-linearly related to another variable(s).   
2.  Create new transformed variables (take linear combinations of variables; create ratio of variables, etc).

# Model Building & Scoring for Prediction {#model}
Chapters \@ref(slr) and \@ref(mlr) only scratch the surface of model building. Linear regression is a great initial approach to take to model building. In fact, in the realm of statistical models, linear regression (calculated by ordinary least squares) is the **best linear unbiased estimator**. The two key pieces to that previous statement are "best" and "unbiased." 

What does it mean to be **unbiased**? Each of the sample coefficients ($\hat{\beta}$'s) in the regression model are estimates of the true coefficients. Just like the statistics back in Chapter \@ref(eda), these sample coefficients have sampling distributions - specifically, normally distributed sampling distributions. The mean of the sampling distribution of $\hat{\beta}_j$ is the true (known) coefficient $\beta_j$. This means the coefficient is unbiased.

In the preceding chapters, we have only scratched the surface of model building. Linear regression is a great initial approach to model building. In fact, in the realm of statistical models, linear regression (calculated by ordinary least squares) is the **best linear unbiased estimator**. The two key pieces to that previous statement are "best" and "unbiased."

The mean of the sampling distribution of $\hat{\beta}_j$ is the true (known) coefficient $\beta_j$. This means the coefficient is unbiased.

What does it mean to be **best**? *IF* the assumptions of ordinary least squares are met fully, then the sampling distributions of the coefficients in the model have the **minimum** variance of all unbiased estimators. 

These two things combined seem like what we want in a model - estimating what we want (unbiased) and doing it in a way that has the minimum amount of variation (best among the unbiased). Again, these rely on the assumptions of linear regression holding true. Another approach to regression would be to use **regularized regression** instead as a different approach to building the model.

## Regularized Regression
As the number of variables in a linear regression model increase, the chances of having a model that meets all of the assumptions starts to diminish. Multicollinearity can pose a large problem with bigger regression models. As previously seen in Chapter \@ref(diag), the coefficients of a linear regression vary widely in the presence of multicollinearity. These variations lead to overfitting of a regression model. **Overfitting** occurs when a dataset predicts the training data it was built off of really well, but does not generalize to the test dataset or the population in general. More formally, these models have higher variance than desired. In those scenarios, moving out of the realm of unbiased estimates may provide a lower variance in the model, even though the model is no longer unbiased as described above. We wouldn't want to be too biased, but some small degree of bias might improve the model's fit overall.

Another potential problem for linear regression is when we have more variables than observations in our dataset. This is a common problem in the space of genetic modeling. In this scenario, the ordinary least squares approach leads to multiple solutions instead of just one. Unfortunately, most of these infinite solutions overfit the problem at hand anyway.

Regularized (or penalized or shrinkage) regression techniques potentially alleviate these problems. Regularized regression puts constraints on the estimated coefficients in our model and *shrink* these estimates to zero. This helps reduce the variation in the coefficients (improving the variance of the model), but at the cost of biasing the coefficients. The specific constraints that are put on the regression inform the three common approaches - **ridge regression**, **LASSO**, and **elastic nets**.

### Penalties in Models
In ordinary least squares linear regression, we minimize the sum of the squared residuals (or errors) as laid out in Chapter @\ref(slr). 

In ordinary least squares linear regression, we minimize the sum of the squared residuals (or errors) as laid out in Chapter \@ref(slr). 

$$
min(\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2) = min(SSE)
$$

In regularized regression, however, we add a penalty term to the $SSE$ as follows:

$$
min(\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 + Penalty) = min(SSE + Penalty)
$$

As mentioned above, the penalties we choose constrain the estimated coefficients in our model and shrink these estimates to zero. Different penalties have different effects on the estimated coefficients. Two common approaches to adding penalties are the ridge and LASSO approaches. The elastic net approach is a combination of these two. Let's explore each of these in further detail!

### Ridge Regression
Ridge regression adds what is commonly referred to as an "$L_2$" penalty:

$$
min(\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^p \hat{\beta}^2_j) = min(SSE + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^p \hat{\beta}^2_j)
$$

This penalty is controlled by the **tuning parameter** $\lambda$. If $\lambda = 0$, then we have typical OLS linear regression. However, as $\lambda \rightarrow \infty$, the coefficients in the model shrink to zero. This makes intuitive sense. Since the estimated coefficients, $\hat{\beta}_j$'s, are the only thing changing to minimize this equation, then as $\lambda \rightarrow \infty$, the equation is best minimized by forcing the coefficients to be smaller and smaller. We will see how to optimize this penalty term in a later section.

Let's build a regularized regression for our Ames dataset. To build a ridge regression we need separate data matrices for our predictors and our target variable. First, we isolate out the variables we are interested in using the ```select``` function. From there the ```model.matrix``` function will create any categorical dummy variables needed. We also isolate the target variable into its own vector.

```{r}
train_reg <- train %>% 
  dplyr::select(Sale_Price, 
         Lot_Area,
         Street,
         Bldg_Type,
         House_Style,
         Overall_Qual,
         Roof_Style,
         Central_Air,
         First_Flr_SF,
         Second_Flr_SF,
         Full_Bath,
         Half_Bath,
         Fireplaces,
         Garage_Area,
         Gr_Liv_Area, 
         TotRms_AbvGrd) %>%
  replace(is.na(.), 0)

train_x <- model.matrix(Sale_Price ~ ., data = train_reg)[, -1]
train_y <- train_reg$Sale_Price
```

We will want to do the same thing for the test dataset as well.

```{r}
test_reg <- test %>% 
  dplyr::select(Sale_Price, 
         Lot_Area,
         Street,
         Bldg_Type,
         House_Style,
         Overall_Qual,
         Roof_Style,
         Central_Air,
         First_Flr_SF,
         Second_Flr_SF,
         Full_Bath,
         Half_Bath,
         Fireplaces,
         Garage_Area,
         Gr_Liv_Area, 
         TotRms_AbvGrd) %>%
  replace(is.na(.), 0)

test_x <- model.matrix(Sale_Price ~ ., data = test_reg)[, -1]
test_y <- test_reg$Sale_Price
```


From there we use the ```glmnet``` function with the ```x = ``` option where we specify the predictor model matrix and the ```y = ``` option where we specify the target variable. The ```alpha = 0``` option specifies that a ridge regression will be used as defined in more detail below in the elastic net section. The ```plot``` function allows us to see the impact of the penalty on the coefficients in the model. 

```{r}
library(glmnet)

ames_ridge <- glmnet(x = train_x,  y = train_y,  alpha = 0)

plot(ames_ridge, xvar = "lambda")
```

The ```glmnet``` function automatically standardizes the variables before fitting the regression model. This is important so that all of the variables are on the same scale before adjustments are made to the estimated coefficients. Even with this standardization we can see the large coefficient values for some of the variables. The top of the plot lists how many variables are in the model at each value of penalty. This will never change for ridge regression, but does for LASSO. 

What $\lambda$ term is best? That will be discussed in the optimizing section below, but let's discuss other possible penalties first.

### LASSO
**Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator** (LASSO) regression adds what is commonly referred to as an "$L_1$" penalty:

$$
min(\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^p |\hat{\beta}_j|) = min(SSE + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^p |\hat{\beta}_j|)
$$

This penalty is controlled by the **tuning parameter** $\lambda$. If $\lambda = 0$, then we have typical OLS linear regression. However, as $\lambda \rightarrow \infty$, the coefficients in the model shrink to zero. This makes intuitive sense. Since the estimated coefficients, $\hat{\beta}_j$'s, are the only thing changing to minimize this equation, then as $\lambda \rightarrow \infty$, the equation is best minimized by forcing the coefficients to be smaller and smaller. We will see how to optimize this penalty term in a later section.

However, unlike ridge regression that has the coefficient estimates approach zero asymptotically, in LASSO regression the coefficients can actually equal zero. This may not be as intuitive when initially looking at the penalty terms themselves. It becomes easier to see when dealing with the solutions to the coefficient estimates. Without going into too much mathematical detail, this is done by taking the derivative of the minimization function (objective function) and setting it equal to zero. From there we can determine the optimal solution for the estimated coefficients. In OLS regression the estimates for the coefficients can be shown to equal the following (in matrix form):

$$
\hat{\beta} = (X^TX)^{-1}X^TY
$$

This changes in the presence of penalty terms. For ridge regression, the solution becomes the following:

$$
\hat{\beta} = (X^TX + \lambda I)^{-1}X^TY
$$

There is no value for $\lambda$ that can force the coefficients to be zero by itself. Therefore, unless the data makes the coefficient zero, the penalty term can only force the estimated coefficient to zero asymptotically as $\lambda \rightarrow \infty$. 

However, for LASSO, the solution becomes the following:

$$
\hat{\beta} = (X^TX)^{-1}(X^TY - \lambda I)
$$

Notice the distinct difference here. In this scenario, there is a possible penalty value ($\lambda = X^TY$) that will force the estimated coefficients to equal zero. There is some benefit to this. This makes LASSO also function as a variable selection criteria as well.

Let's build a regularized regression for our Ames dataset using the LASSO approach. To build a LASSO regression we need separate data matrices for our predictors and our target variable just like we did for ridge. From there we use the ```glmnet``` function with the ```x = ``` option where we specify the predictor model matrix and the ```y = ``` option where we specify the target variable. The ```alpha = 1``` option specifies that a LASSO regression will be used as defined in more detail below in the elastic net section. The ```plot``` function allows us to see the impact of the penalty on the coefficients in the model. 

```{r}
ames_lasso <- glmnet(x = train_x,  y = train_y,  alpha = 1)

plot(ames_lasso, xvar = "lambda")
```

The ```glmnet``` function automatically standardizes the variables before fitting the regression model. This is important so that all of the variables are on the same scale before adjustments are made to the estimated coefficients. Even with this standardization we can see the large coefficient values for some of the variables. The top of the plot lists how many variables are in the model at each value of penalty. Notice as the penalty increases, the number of variables decreases as variables are forced to zero. 

What $\lambda$ term is best? That will be discussed in the optimizing section below, but let's discuss the last possible penalty first - the combination of both ridge and LASSO.

### Elastic Net
Which approach is better, ridge or LASSO? Both have advantages and disadvantages. LASSO performs variable selection while ridge keeps all variables in the model. However, reducing the number of variables might impact minimum error. Also, if you have two correlated variables, which one LASSO chooses to zero out is relatively arbitrary to the context of the problem. 

Elastic nets were designed to take advantage of both penalty approaches. In elastic nets, we are using both penalties in the minimization:

$$
min(SSE + \lambda_1 \sum_{j=1}^p |\hat{\beta}_j| + \lambda_2 \sum_{j=1}^p \hat{\beta}^2_j) 
$$

In R, the ```glmnet``` function takes a slightly different approach to the elastic net implementation with the following:

$$
min(SSE + \lambda[ \alpha \sum_{j=1}^p |\hat{\beta}_j| + (1-\alpha) \sum_{j=1}^p \hat{\beta}^2_j]) 
$$

R still has one penalty $\lambda$, however, it includes the $\alpha$ parameter to balance between the two penalty terms. This is why in ```glmnet```, the ```alpha = 1``` option gives a LASSO regression and ```alpha = 0``` gives a ridge regression. Any value in between zero and one will provide an elastic net.

Let's build a regularized regression for our Ames dataset using the elastic net approach with an $\alpha = 0.5$. To build am elastic net we need separate data matrices for our predictors and our target variable just like we did for ridge and LASSO. From there we use the ```glmnet``` function with the ```x = ``` option where we specify the predictor model matrix and the ```y = ``` option where we specify the target variable. The ```alpha = 0.5``` option specifies that an elastic net will be used since it is between zero and one. The ```plot``` function allows us to see the impact of the penalty on the coefficients in the model. 

```{r}
ames_en <- glmnet(x = train_x,  y = train_y,  alpha = 0.5)

plot(ames_en, xvar = "lambda")
```

The ```glmnet``` function automatically standardizes the variables before fitting the regression model. This is important so that all of the variables are on the same scale before adjustments are made to the estimated coefficients. Even with this standardization we can see the large coefficient values for some of the variables. The top of the plot lists how many variables are in the model at each value of penalty. Notice as the penalty increases, the number of variables decreases as variables are forced to zero using the LASSO piece of the elastic net penalty. 

What $\lambda$ term is best? What is the proper balance between ridge and LASSO penalties when building an elastic net? That will be discussed in the following section.

## Optimizing Penalties
No matter the approach listed above, a penatly term $\lambda$ needs to be picked. However, we do not want to get caught overfitting our training data by minimizing the variance so much that it is not generalizable to the overall pattern and other similar data. Take the following plot:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
x <- seq(-5, 5, 0.1)
y <- x^3 - 25*x + 5 + rnorm(length(x), 0, 8)

df_cubic <- data.frame(x,y)

ggplot(df_cubic, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, formula = y ~ poly(x, 3), se = FALSE, colour = "lightblue") +  
  geom_smooth(method = lm, formula = y ~ poly(x, 26), se = FALSE, colour = "red", linetype = "dashed") +  
  geom_smooth(method = lm, formula = y ~ poly(x, 2), se = FALSE, colour = "orange", linetype = "dotted") +  
  theme_classic()
```

The red line is overfitted to the dataset and picks up too much of the unimportant pattern. The orange dotted line is underfit as it does not pick up enough of the pattern. The light blue, solid line is fit well to the dataset as it picks up the general pattern while not overfitting to the dataset.

### Cross-Validation
**Cross-validation** is a common approach in modeling to prevent overfitting of data when you need to **tune** a parameter. The idea of cross-validation is to split the training data into multiple pieces, build the model on a majority of the pieces while evaluating it on the remaining piece. Then we do the same process again, but switch out which pieces the model is built and evaluated on.

A common cross-validation (CV) approach is the $k$-fold CV. In the $k$-fold CV approach, the model is built $k$ times. The data is initially split into $k$ equally sized pieces. Each time the model is built, it is built off of $k-1$ pieces of the data and evaluated on the last piece. This process is repeated until each piece is left out for evaluation. This is diagrammed below in Figure \@ref(fig:kCV). 

```{r label='kCV', fig.align='center', fig.cap = 'Example of a 10-fold Cross-Validation', echo=F, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/kCV.png")
```

### CV in Regularized Regression
In R, the ```cv.glmnet``` function will automatically implement a 10-fold CV (by default, but can be adjusted through options) to help evaluate and optimize the $\lambda$ values for our regularized regression models. 

Let's perform an example using the LASSO regression. The ```cv.glmnet``` function takes the same inputs as the ```glmnet``` function above. Again, we will use the ```plot``` function, but this time we get a different plot. 

```{r}
ames_lasso_cv <- cv.glmnet(x = train_x,  y = train_y,  alpha = 1)

plot(ames_lasso_cv)

ames_lasso_cv$lambda.min 
ames_lasso_cv$lambda.1se
```

The above plot shows the results from our cross-validation. Here the models are evaluated based on their **mean-squared error** (MSE). The MSE is defined as $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$. The $\lambda$ value that minimizes the MSE is 49.69435 (with a $\log(\lambda)$ = 3.91). This is highlighted by the first, vertical dashed line. The second vertical dashed line is the largest $\lambda$ value that is one standard error above the minimum value. This value is especially useful in LASSO regressions. The largest $\lambda$ within one standard error would provide approximately the same MSE, but with a further reduction in the number of variables. Notice that to go from the first line to the second, the change in MSE is very small, but the reduction of variables is from 36 variables to around 12 variables. 

Let's look at the impact on the coefficients under this penalty using the ```glmnet``` function as before.

```{r}
plot(ames_lasso, xvar = "lambda")
abline(v = log(ames_lasso_cv$lambda.1se), col = "red", lty = "dashed")
abline(v = log(ames_lasso_cv$lambda.min), col = "black", lty = "dashed")
```

To investigate which variables are important at a $\lambda$ value, we can view the coefficients using the ```coef``` function. They are ranked here:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
coef(ames_lasso, s = ames_lasso_cv$lambda.1se) %>%
  broom::tidy() %>%
  filter(row != "(Intercept)") %>%
  ggplot(aes(value, reorder(row, value))) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Influential Variables") +
  xlab("Coefficient") +
  ylab(NULL)
```

The variable describing the overall quality of the home is the driving factor of this model as well as the other variables listed above.

A similar approach can be taken for CV with ridge regression using the same structure of code. That will not be covered here. Elastic nets are more complicated in that they have multiple parameters to optimize. For that approach, an optimization grid will need to be structured to evaluate different $\lambda$ values across different $\alpha$ values. A loop can be set up to run the ```cv.glmnet``` function across many different values of $\alpha$. That will not be covered in detail here. 

## Model Comparisons
Now we have multiple models built for our dataset. To help evaluate which model is better, we will use the test dataset as described in Chapter \@ref(slr). 

The models we have built are nothing but formulas. All we have to do is put the test dataset in the formula to predict/score the test data. We **do not** rerun the algorithm as the goal is **not** to fit the test dataset, but to just score it. We need to make sure that we have the same structure to the test dataset that we do with the training dataset. Any variable transformations, new variable creations, and missing value imputations done on the training dataset must be done on the test dataset in the same way.

### Model Metrics
Once the predicted values are obtained from each model we need to evaluate good these predictions are. There are many different metrics to evaluate models depending on what type of target variable that you have. Some common metrics for continuous target variables are the square root of the mean squared error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). 

The RMSE is evaluated as follows:

$$
RMSE = \sqrt {\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}
$$
The RMSE is an approximation of the standard deviation of the prediction errors of the model. The downside of the RMSE is a lack of interpretability.

The MAE is evaluated as follows:

$$
MAE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n |y_i - \hat{y}_i|
$$
The MAE gives the average absolute difference between our predictions and the actual values. This is a symmetric measure with great interpretability. The main disadvantage of this metric is that it depends on the scale of the data. For comparing two models evaluated on the same data, this isn't important. However, when comparing across different datasets, this may not be as helpful. For example, in temperature predictions, having an MAE of five degrees for a model built on Honolulu, Hawaii weather might not be comparable to a model built on weather in Raleigh, North Carolina.

The MAPE is evaluated as follows:

$$
MAPE = 100 \times \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n |\frac{y_i - \hat{y}_i}{y_i}|
$$
The MAPE gives the average absolute *percentage* difference between our predictions and the actual values. This metric is very interpretable and not dependent on the scale of the data. However, it is not symmetric like the MAE.

### Test Dataset Comparison
The final model we had from Chapter \@ref(diag) had the variables . From this model we can use the ```predict``` function with the ```newdata = ``` option to use score the ```test``` dataset. 

```{r}
test$pred_lm <- predict(ames_lm, newdata = test)

head(test$pred_lm)
```

To get predictions from the regularized regression models, a $\lambda$ value must be selected. For the previous LASSO regression we will choose the largest $\lambda$ value within one standard error of the minimum $\lambda$ value to help reduce the number of variables. Again, we will use the ```predict``` function. The ```s = ``` option is where we input the $\lambda$ value. The ```newx = ``` option is where we specify the ```test``` dataset. 

```{r}
test_reg$pred_lasso <- predict(ames_lasso, s = ames_lasso_cv$lambda.1se, newx = test_x)

head(test_reg$pred_lasso)
```

Now we need to calculate the MAE and MAPE for each model for comparison.

```{r}
test %>%
  mutate(lm_APE = 100*abs((Sale_Price - pred_lm)/Sale_Price)) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(MAPE_lm = mean(lm_APE))

test_reg %>%
  mutate(lasso_APE = 100*abs((Sale_Price - pred_lasso)/Sale_Price)) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(MAPE_lasso = mean(lasso_APE))

```

From the above results, the linear regression from LASSO has a lower MAPE. 

Once we have scored models with the test dataset, we should **not** go back to try and rebuild any models. We will use the model with the lowest MAE or MAPE. This number is also the number that we report on how well our model performs. No metrics on the training dataset should be reported for the performance of the model.

# Categorical Data Analysis {#cat}
Everything analysis covered so far has used a continuous variable as a target variable of interest. What if our target variable was categorical instead of continuous? Our analysis must change to adjust. 

This Chapter aims to answer the following questions:
<ul>
  <li> How do you explore categorical variables? 
    <ul> 
      <li> Nominal vs. Ordinal
      <li> Tests of Association
      <li> Measures of Association
    </ul>
  <li> How do you model a categorical target variable?
    <ul>
      <li> Logistic Regression
      <li> Interpreting Logistic Regression
      <li> Assessing Logistic Regression
    </ul>
</ul>

## Describing Categorical Data
Similar to Chapter \@ref(eda), we need to first explore our data before building any models to try and explain/predict our categorical target variable. With categorical variables, we can look at the distribution of the categories as well as see if this distribution has any association with other variables. For this analysis we are going to still use our Ames housing data. Imagine you worked for a real estate agency and got a bonus check if you sold a house above \$175,000 in value. Let's create this variable in our data:

```{r}
train <- train %>%
  mutate(Bonus = ifelse(Sale_Price > 175000, 1, 0))
```

You are interested in what variables might be associated with obtaining a higher chance of getting a bonus (selling a house above \$175,000). An association exists between two categorical variables if the distribution of one variable changes when the value of the other categorical changes. If there is no association, the distribution of the first variable is the same regardless of the value of the other variable. For example, if we wanted to know if obtaining a bonus on selling a house in Ames, Iowa was associated with whether the house had central air we could look at the distribution of bonus eligible houses. If we observe that 42% of homes with central air are bonus eligible and 42% of homes without central air are bonus eligible, then it appears that central air has no bearing on whether the home is bonus eligible. However, if instead we observe that only 3% of homes without central air are bonus eligible, but 44% of home with central air are bonus eligible, then it appears that having central air might be related to a home being bonus eligible.

To understand the distribution of categorical variables we need to look at frequency tables. A frequency table shows the number of observations that occur in certain categories or intervals. A one way frequency table examines all the categories of one variable. These are easily visualized with bar charts.

Let's look at the distribution of both bonus eligibility and central air using the ```table``` function. The ```ggplot``` function with the ```geom_bar``` function allows us to view our data in a bar chart.

```{r}
table(train$Bonus)

ggplot(data = train) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = Bonus))
```

```{r}
table(train$Central_Air)

ggplot(data = train) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = Central_Air))
```

Frequency tables show single variables, but if we want to explore two variables together we look at **cross-tabulation** tables. A cross-tabulation table shows the number of observations for each combination of the row and column variables. 

Let's again examine bonus eligibility, but this time across levels of central air. Again, we can use the ```table``` function. The ```prop.table``` function allows us to compare two variables in terms of proportions instead of frequencies.

```{r}
table(train$Central_Air, train$Bonus)

prop.table(table(train$Central_Air, train$Bonus))

ggplot(data = train) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = Bonus, fill = Central_Air))
```

From the above output we can see that 147 homes have no central air with only 5 of them being bonus eligible. However, there are 1904 homes that have central air with 835 of them being bonus eligible. For an even more detailed breakdown we can use the ```CrossTable``` function.

```{r}
library(gmodels)

CrossTable(train$Central_Air, train$Bonus)
```

The advantage of the ```CrossTable``` function is that we can easily get not only the frequencies, but the cell, row, and column proportions. For example, the third number in each cell gives us the row proportion. For homes without central air, 96.6% of them are not bonus eligible, while 3.4% of them are. For homes with central air, 56.1% of the homes are not bonus eligible, while 43.9% of them are. This would appear that the distribution of bonus eligible homes changes across levels of central air - a relationship between the two variables. This expected relationship needs to be tested statistically for verification.

## Tests of Association
Much like in Chapter \@ref(slr) we have statistical tests to evaluate relationships between two categorical variables. The null hypothesis for these statistical tests is that the two variables have no association - the distribution of one variable does not change across levels of another variable. The alternative hypothesis is an association between the two variables - the distribution of one variable changes across levels of another variable.

These statistical tests follow a $\chi^2$-distribution. The $\chi^2$-distribution is a distribution that has the following characteristics:
  <ul> 
    <li> Bounded below by 0
    <li> Right-skewed
    <li> One set of degrees of freedom
  </ul>

A plot of a variety of $\chi^2$-distributions is shown here:

```{r echo=FALSE}
data.frame(f = 0:1500 / 100) %>% 
           mutate(df_1 = dchisq(x = f, df = 1),
                  df_2 = dchisq(x = f, df = 2),
                  df_3 = dchisq(x = f, df = 3),
                  df_5 = dchisq(x = f, df = 5),
                  df_10 = dchisq(x = f, df = 10)) %>%
  gather(key = "df", value = "density", -f) %>%
ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = f, y = density, color = df, linetype = df)) +
  labs(title = "Chi-Square at Various Degrees of Freedom",
       x = "Chi-Square",
       y = "Density") +
  xlim(0,15) + ylim(0,1) +theme_minimal()
```

Two common $\chi^2$ tests are the Pearson and Likelihood Ratio $\chi^2$ tests. They compare the observed count of observations in each cell of a cross-tabulation table between two variables to their expected count **if** there was no relationship. The expected cell count applies the overall distribution of one variable across all the levels of the other variable. For example, overall 59% of all homes are not bonus eligible. **If** that were to apply to every level of central air, then the 140 homes without central air would be expected to have 86.73 ( $ = 147 \times 0.59 $ ) of them would be bonus eligible while 60.27 ( $ = 147 \times 0.41$ ) of them would not be bonus eligible. We actually observe 142 and 5 homes for each of these categories respectively. The further the observed data is from the expected data, the more evidence we have that there is a relationship between the two variables.

The test statistic for the Pearson $\chi^2$ test is the following:

$$
\chi^2_P = \sum_{i=1}^R \sum_{j=1}^C \frac{(Obs_{i,j} - Exp_{i,j})^2}{Exp_{i,j}}
$$
From the equation above, the closer that the observed count of each cross-tabulation table cell to the expected count, the smaller the test statistic. As with all previous hypothesis tests, the smaller the test statistic, the larger the p-value, implying less evidence for the alternative hypothesis. 

Let's examine the relationship between central air and bonus eligibility using the ```chisq.test``` function.

```{r}
chisq.test(table(train$Central_Air, train$Bonus))
```

The above results shows an extremely small p-value that is below any reasonable significance level. This implies that we have statistical evidence for a relationship between having central air and bonus eligibility of homes. The p-value comes from a $\chi^2$-distribution with degrees of freedom that equal the product of the number of rows minus one and the number of columns minus one.

Another common test is the Likelihood Ratio test. The test statistic for this is the following:

$$
\chi^2_L = 2 \times \sum_{i=1}^R \sum_{j=1}^C Obs_{i,j} \times \log(\frac{Obs_{i,j}}{Exp_{i,j}})
$$

The p-value comes from a $\chi^2$-distribution with degrees of freedom that equal the product of the number of rows minus one and the number of columns minus one. Both of the above tests have a sample size requirement. The sample size requirement is 80% or more of the cells in the cross-tabulation table need **expected** count larger
than 5.

For smaller sample sizes, this might be hard to meet. In those situations, we can use a more computationally expensive test called Fisher's exact test. This test calculates every possible permutation of the data being evaluated to calculate the p-value without any distributional assumptions. To perform this test we can use the ```fisher.test``` function.

```{r}
fisher.test(table(train$Central_Air, train$Bonus))
```

We see the same results as with the Pearson test because the assumptions were met for sample size. 

Both the Pearson and Likelihood Ratio $\chi^2$ tests can handle any type of categorical variable either ordinal, nominal, or both. However, ordinal variables provide us extra information since the order of the categories actually matters compared to nominal. We can test for even more with ordinal variables against other ordinal variables whether two ordinal variables have a **linear relationship** as compared to just a general one. An ordinal test for association is the Mantel-Haenszel $\chi^2$ test. The test statistic for the Mantel-Haenszel $\chi^2$ test is the following:

$$
\chi^2_{MH} = (n-1)r^2
$$
where $r^2$ is the Pearson correlation between the column and row variables. This test follows a $\chi^2$-distribution with only one degree of freedom.

Since both the central air and bonus eligibility variables are binary, they are ordinal. Since they are both ordinal, we should use the Mantel-Haenszel $\chi^2$ test with the ```CMHtest``` function. In the main output table, the first row is the Mantel-Haenszel $\chi^2$ test.

```{r}
library(vcdExtra)

CMHtest(table(train$Central_Air, train$Bonus))$table[1,]
```

From here we can see another extremely small p-value as we saw in earlier, more general $\chi^2$ tests. 

## Measures of Association
Tests of association are best designed for just that, testing the existence of an association between two categorical variables. However, just like we saw in Chapter \@ref(eda), hypothesis tests are impacted by sample size. When we have the same sample size, tests of association can rank significance of variables with p-values. However, when sample sizes are not the same between two tests, the tests of association are not best for comparing the strength of an association. In those scenarios, we have measures of strength of association that can be compared across any sample size. 

Measures of association were not designed to test if an association exists, as that is what statistical testing is for. They are designed to measure the strength of association. There are dozens of these measures. Three of the most common are the following:
- Odds Ratios (only for comparing two binary variables)
- Cramer's V (able to compare nominal variables with any number of categories)
- Spearman's Correlation (able to compare ordinal variables with any number of categories)

An **odds ratio** indicates how much more likely, with respect to **odds**, a certain event occurs in one group relative to its occurrence in another group. The odds of an event occurring is *not* the same as the probability that an event occurs. The odds of an event occurring is the probability the event occurs divided by the probability that event does not occur.

$$
Odds = \frac{p}{1-p}
$$

Let's again examine the cross-tabulation table between central air and bonus eligibility.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
CrossTable(train$Central_Air, train$Bonus)
```

Let's look at the row without central air. The probability that a home without central air is not bonus eligible is 96.6%. That implies that the odds of not being bonus eligible in homes without central air is 28.41 (= 0.966/0.034). For homes with central air, the odds of not being bonus eligible are 1.28 (= 0.561/0.439). The odds ratio between these two would be approximately 22.2 (= 28.41/1.28). In other words, homes without central air are 22.2 times more likely (in terms of odds) to not be bonus eligible as compared to homes with central air. This relationship is intuitive based on the numbers we have seen. Without going into details, it can also be shown that homes with central air are 22.2 times as likely (in terms of odds) to be bonus eligible.

We can use the ```OddsRatio``` function to get these same results.

```{r}
library(DescTools)

OddsRatio(table(train$Central_Air, train$Bonus))
```

**Cramer's V** is another measure of strength of association. Cramer's V is calculated as follows:

$$
V = \sqrt{\frac{\chi^2_P/n}{\min(Rows-1, Columns-1)}}
$$

Cramer's V is bounded between 0 and 1 for every comparison other than two binary variables. For two binary variables being compared the bounds are -1 to 1. The idea is still the same for both. The further the value is from 0, the stronger the relationship. Unfortunately, unlike $R^2$, Cramer's V has no interpretative value. It can only be used for comparison.

We use the ```assocstats``` function to get the Cramer's V value. This function also provides the Pearson and Likelihood Ratio $\chi^2$ tests as well.

```{r}
assocstats(table(train$Central_Air, train$Bonus))
```

Lastly, we have Spearman's correlation. Much like the Mantel-Haenszel test of association was specifically designed for comparing two ordinal variables, Spearman correlation measures the strength of association between two ordinal variables. Spearman is not limited to only categorical data analysis as it was also seen back in Chapter \@ref(diag) with detecting heteroskedasticity. Remember, Spearman correlation is a correlation on the ranks of the observations as compared to the actual values of the observations.

The ```cor.test``` function that gave us Pearson's correlation also provides Spearman's correlation. 

```{r, warning=FALSE}
cor.test(x = as.numeric(ordered(train$Central_Air)), 
         y = as.numeric(ordered(train$Bonus)), 
         method = "spearman")
```

As previously mentioned, these are only a few of the dozens of different measures of association that exist. However, they are the most used ones.

## Introduction to Logistic Regression
After exploring the categorical target variable, we can move on to modeling the categorical target variable. Logistic regression is a fundamental statistical analysis for data science and analytics. It part of a class of modeling techniques known as classification models since they are trying to predict categorical target variables. This target variable can be binary, ordinal, or even nominal in its structure. The primary focus will be binary logistic regression. It is the most common type of logistic regression, and sets up the foundation for both ordinal and nominal logistic regression.

Ordinary least squares regression is not the best approach to modeling categorical target variables. Mathematically, it can be shown that with a binary target variable coded as 0 and 1, an OLS linear regression model will produce the **linear probability model**.

### Linear Probability Model
The linear probability model is not as widely used since probabilities do not tend to follow the properties of linearity in relation to their predictors. Also, the linear probability model possibly produces predictions outside of the bounds of 0 and 1 (where probabilities should be!). For completeness sake however, here is the linear probability model using the ```lm``` function to try and predict bonus eligibility.

```{r}
lp.model <- lm(Bonus ~ Gr_Liv_Area, data = train)

with(train, plot(x = Gr_Liv_Area, y = Bonus,
               main = 'OLS Regression?',
               xlab = 'Greater Living Area (Sqft)',
               ylab = 'Bonus Eligibility'))
abline(lp.model)
```

Even though it doesn't appear to really look like our data, let's fit this linear probability model anyway for completeness sake.

```{r, engine='R'}
lp.model <- lm(Bonus ~ Gr_Liv_Area, data = train)

summary(lp.model)

qqnorm(rstandard(lp.model),
       ylab = "Standardized Residuals",
       xlab = "Normal Scores",
       main = "QQ-Plot of Residuals")
qqline(rstandard(lp.model))

plot(predict(lp.model), resid(lp.model), 
     ylab="Residuals", xlab="Predicted Values", 
     main="Residuals of Linear Probability Model") 
abline(0, 0) 
```

As we can see from the charts above, the assumptions of ordinary least squares don't really hold in this situation. Therefore, we should be careful interpreting the results of the model. Maybe a better model won't have these problems?

### Binary Logistic Regression
Due to the limitations of the linear probability model, people typically just use the binary logistic regression model. The logistic regression model does not have the limitations of the linear probability model. The outcome of the logistic regression model is the probability of getting a 1 in a binary variable. That probability is calculated as follows:

$$
p_i = \frac{1}{1+e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1x_{1,i} + \cdots + \beta_k x_{k,i})}}
$$

This function has the desired properties for predicting probabilities. The predicted probability from the above equation will always be between 0 and 1. The parameter estimates do not enter the function linearly (this is a non-linear regression model), and the rate of change of the probability varies as the predictor variables vary as seen in Figure \@ref(fig:logistic).

```{r label='logistic', fig.align='center', fig.cap = 'Example of a Logistic Curve', echo=F, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/logistic.png")
```

To create a linear model, a **link function** is applied to the probabilities. The specific link function for logistic regression is called the **logit** function.

$$
logit(p_i) = \log(\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{1,i} + \cdots + \beta_k x_{k,i}
$$

The relationship between the predictor variables and the logits are linear in nature as the logits themselves are unbounded. This structure looks much more like our linear regression model structure. However, logistic regression does not use OLS to estimate the coefficients in our model. OLS requires residuals which the logistic regression model does not provide. The target variable is binary in nature, but the predictions are probabilities. Therefore, we cannot calculate a traditional residual. Instead, logistic regression uses maximum likelihood estimation. This is not covered here.

There are two main assumptions for logistic regression:

1. Independence of observations
2. Linearity of the logit

The first assumption of independence is the same as we had for linear regression. The second assumption implies that the logistic function transformation (the logit) actually makes a linear relationship with our predictor variables. This assumption can be tested, but will not be covered in this brief introduction to logistic regression.

Let's build a logistic regression model. We will use the ```glm``` function to do this. The ```glm``` function has a similar structure to the ```lm``` function. The main difference is the ```family = binomial(link = "logit")``` option to specify that we are uses a logistic regression model. Again, there are many different link functions, but only the logistic link function (the logit) is being used here.

```{r}
ames_logit <- glm(Bonus ~ Gr_Liv_Area, 
                   data = train, family = binomial(link = "logit"))
summary(ames_logit)
```

Let's examine the above output. Scanning down the output, you can see the actual logistic regression equation for the variable ```Gr_Liv_Area```. Here we can see that it appears to be a significant variable at predicting bonus eligibility. However, the coefficient reported does not have the same usable interpretation as in linear regression. An increase of one unit of greater living area square footage is linearly related to the logit **not** the probability of bonus eligibility. We can transform this coefficient to make it more interpretable. A single unit increase in greater living area square footage **does** have a $100 \times (e^\hat{\beta}-1)\%$ increase in the average **odds** of bonus eligibility. We can use a combination of the ```exp``` and ```coef``` functions to obtain this number.

```{r}
100*(exp(cbind(coef(ames_logit), confint(ames_logit)))-1)
```

In other words, every additional square foot in greater living area in the home leads to an average increase in odds of 0.385% to be bonus eligible. 

### Adding Categorical Variables
Similar to linear regression as we learned in Chapter \@ref(mlr), logistic regression can have both continuous and categorical predictors for our categorical target variable. Let's add both central air as well as number of fireplaces to our logistic regression model.

```{r}
ames_logit2 <- glm(Bonus ~ Gr_Liv_Area + Central_Air + factor(Fireplaces), 
                  data = train, family = binomial(link = "logit"))
summary(ames_logit2)
```

Just like with linear regression, categorical predictor variables are a comparison between two categories. Again, the coefficients from the logistic regression model need to be transformed to be interpreted.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
100*(exp(cbind(coef(ames_logit2), confint(ames_logit2)))-1)
```

Let's use the first fireplace variable as an example. A home with one fireplace has, on average, 167.04% higher odds of being bonus eligible as compared to a home with zero fireplaces.

### Model Assessment
There are dozens of different ways to evaluate a logistic regression model. We will cover one popular way here - concordance. Counting the number of **concordant**, **discordant**, and **tied** pairs is a way to to assess how well the model fits the data. 

To find concordant, discordant, and tied pairs, we must compare all of the 0's in the target variable to all of the 1's. For our example, we will compare every pair of homes where one home is bonus eligible and one is not (every 0 and 1 pair). A **concordant** pair is a 0 and 1 pair where the bonus eligible home (the 1 in our model) has a higher predicted probability than the non-bonus eligible home (the 0 in our model) - our model successfully ordered these two observations by probability. It does not matter what the actual predicted probability values are as long as the bonus eligible home has a higher predicted probability than the non-bonus eligible home. A **discordant** pair is a 0 and 1 pair where the bonus eligible home (the 1 in our model) has a lower predicted probability than the non-bonus eligible home (the 0 in our model) - our model unsuccessfully ordered the homes. It does not matter what the actual predicted probability values are as long as the bonus eligible home has a lower predicted probability than the non-bonus eligible home. A **tied** pair is a 0 and 1 pair where the bonus eligible home has the same predicted probability as the non-bonus eligible home - the model is confused and sees these two different things as the same. In general, you want a high percentage of concordant pairs and low percentages of discordant and tied pairs. 

We can use the ```Concordance``` function to obtain these values on our predictions from the ```predict``` function.

```{r}
library(InformationValue)

Concordance(train$Bonus, predict(ames_logit, type = "response"))
```

From the above output we have a concordance of 86.3% for our model. There is no good or bad value as this can only be compared with another model to see which is better. Let's compare this to our model with the categorical variables.

```{r}
Concordance(train$Bonus, predict(ames_logit2, type = "response"))
```

We can see that the model with categorical predictors added to it has a higher concordance at 88.4%. That implies that our model is correctly able to rank our observations 88.4% of the time. This is **NOT** the same thing as saying our model is 88.4% accurate. Accuracy (which is not covered here) deals with a prediction being correct or incorrect. Concordance is only measuring how often we are able to predict 1's with higher probability than 0's - again, correctly ranking the observations.

### Variable Selection and Regularized Regression
As with linear regression in Chapters \@ref(reg) and \@ref(sel), logistic regression uses the same approaches to doing variable selection. In fact, the same function are used as well. Let's use the ```step``` function to apply a forward and backward selection to the logistic regression model.

```{r}
train_sel_log <- train %>% 
  dplyr::select(Bonus, 
         Lot_Area,
         Street,
         Bldg_Type,
         House_Style,
         Overall_Qual,
         Roof_Style,
         Central_Air,
         First_Flr_SF,
         Second_Flr_SF,
         Full_Bath,
         Half_Bath,
         Fireplaces,
         Garage_Area,
         Gr_Liv_Area, 
         TotRms_AbvGrd) %>%
  replace(is.na(.), 0)

full.model <- glm(Bonus ~ . , data = train_sel_log)

empty.model <- glm(Bonus ~ 1, data = train_sel_log)
```

```{r}
for.model <- step(empty.model,
                  scope = list(lower = formula(empty.model),
                               upper = formula(full.model)),
                  direction = "forward", k = log(dim(train_sel_log)[1]))
```

```{r}
back.model <- step(full.model,
                   scope = list(lower = formula(empty.model),
                                upper = formula(full.model)),
                   direction = "backward", k = log(dim(train_sel_log)[1]))
```

In the above two approaches we used the BIC selection criteria. Here both forward and backward selection actually picked the same model. Let's check the concordance of this model.

```{r}
Concordance(train$Bonus, predict(back.model, type = "response"))
```

Not surprisingly, this model outperforms the previous model that we had with a concordance of 96.1%. 

Although not covered in detail here, regularized regression can also be applied to logistic regression to get a different view. This might be helpful with the multicollinearity present in these predictor variables. Again, we can use the ```glmnet``` function with the addition of a ```family = "binomial"``` option.
